PyPy is a `very compliant`_ implementation of the `Python`_ language.
PyPy has several advantages and distinctive features:

  * **Speed:** thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs
    often run `faster`_ on PyPy.  `(What is a JIT compiler?)`_

  * **Memory usage:** large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up
    taking `less space`_ than they do in CPython.

  * **Sandboxing:** PyPy provides the ability to `run untrusted code`_ in a
    fully secure way.

  * **Stackless:** PyPy can be configured to run in `stackless`_ mode,
    providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.

  * As well as other `features`_.

Compatibility_ page.  PyPy can run such python libraries as `twisted`_
and `django`_ and supports `ctypes`_.
