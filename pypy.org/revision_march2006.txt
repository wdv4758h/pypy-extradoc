In order to have an external website servicing information in connection 
to pressreleases and more external newsletter the pypy org page needs updating.

The following changes/adds needs to be done:

- info regarding industrial impact (why PyPy, gains? what will it provide, which industries/languages
  do we target - who will have use of PyPy???? This info could be on the main page (HOME)
