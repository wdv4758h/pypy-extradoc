Review passed with flying colours
---------------------------------

On the 31st of May 2007 the PyPy project was reviewed by the EU
Commission in Brussels. Reviewers were Roel Wuyts, Unversité Libre de
Bruxelles and Aki Lumiaho, Ramboll, Finland. Present was also our
Project Officer, Charles McMillan. After 6 hours of presentations of
the various aspects of the project, it only took the reviewers a few
minutes to decide that the project was accepted, without any further
work being required. Professor Wuyts, who has dynamic programming
languages as his main field of research was very enthusiastic about
the entire project and the results with the Just In Time Compiler
Generator in particular. He offered his help in establishing
collaborations with the communities around Prolog, Smalltalk, Lisp and
other dynamic languages, as well as giving hints on how to get our
results most widely pubicized.

The preparations for the review left the team rather exhausted so
development progress will be rather slow until the sprint at
Europython in the second week of July.

PyPy EU funding period over, Review ahead 
-----------------------------------------------------

The 28 month EU project period of PyPy is over and new things are to come!  
On 11th May we `submitted last documents`_ to the European Union and are now 
heading towards a 31st May Review Meeting in Bruxelles.  The `PyPy EU Final
Activity Report`_ summarizes what we did and what we have in mind
on technical, scientific and community levels.  It also contains reflections 
and recommendations possibly interesting to other projects aiming at 
EU funded Open Source research. *(12th May, 2007)*
