PyPy Tutorial - NumPy?
======================

Hi,

We're very excited for our upcoming tutorial at PyCon, and we can't wait to
see you there. As we prepare our material, we're interested in what material
will be most interesting and helpful to you, so we're going to have a lot of
questions for you. Right now we'd like to know, are you interested in hearing
about NumPy for PyPy? As you may know PyPy is working on it's own
implementation of NumPy, with rapidly increasing compatibility, and
performance. However, it does have a pretty different performance profile from
CPython's NumPy. If you're interested in hearing about this in our tutorial,
please let us know.

We also plan on going through an open source application and demonstrating some
performance analysis and optimization on it. If you could give us a list of a
few open source application you'd like to see us take a look at, and we'll
choose the most popular one.

Please write back to us at alex.gaynor@gmail.com and fijall@gmail.com .

Thanks,
Alex Gaynor, Maciej Fijalkoski, Armin Rigo
