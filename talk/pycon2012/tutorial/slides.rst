* Memory
* Sandbox

Performance
===========

* Sweetspot?
  * CPython's sweetspot: stuff written in C
  * PyPy's sweetspot: lots of stuff written in Python
* http://speed.pypy.org
* How do you hit the sweetspot?
  * Be in this room for the next 3 hours.

Memory
======

* PyPy memory usage is difficult to estimate.
* Very program dependent.
* Learn to predict!

Sandbox
=======

* We're not going to talk about it here.
* Run untrusted code.
