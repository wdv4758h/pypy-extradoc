	abstract = {The Smalltalk-80* programming language includes dynamic storage allocation, full upward funargs, and universally polymorphic procedures; the Smalltalk-80 programming system features interactive execution with incremental compilation, and implementation portability. These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually. A new implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete (object code) compatibility with existing implementations. This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages. The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.},

	abstract = {Most Prolog implementations are implemented in low-level languages such as C and are based on a variation of the {WAM} instruction set, which enhances their performance but makes them hard to write. In addition, many of the more dynamic features of Prolog (like assert), despite their popularity, are not well supported. We present a high-level continuation-based Prolog interpreter based on the {PyPy} project. The {PyPy} project makes it possible to easily and efficiently implement dynamic languages. It provides tools that automatically generate a just-in-time compiler for a given interpreter of the target language, by using partial evaluation techniques. The resulting Prolog implementation is surprisingly efficient: it clearly outperforms existing interpreters of Prolog in high-level languages such as Java. Moreover, on some benchmarks, our system outperforms state-of-the-art {WAM-based} Prolog implementations. Our paper aims to show that declarative languages such as Prolog can indeed benefit from having a just-in-time compiler and that {PyPy} can form the basis for implementing programming languages other than Python.},

Though this approach to region selection has worked well in practice, we show that it is possible to adapt this basic approach to produce regions with greater locality, less needless code duplication, and fewer profiling counters. In particular, we propose two new region-selection algorithms and evaluate them against Dynamo¿s selection mechanism, {Next-Executing} Tail {(NET).} Our first algorithm, {Last-Executed} Iteration {(LEI)}, identifies cyclic paths of execution better than {NET}, improving locality of execution while reducing the size of the code cache. Our second algorithm allows overlapping traces of similar execution frequency to be combined into a single large region. This second technique can be applied to both {NET} and {LEI}, and we find that it significantly improves metrics of locality and memory overhead for each.},

Interpreters are significantly slower than compiled machine code because they have a high dispatch overhead and cannot perform optimizations. To overcome these limitations, interpreters are commonly combined with just-in-time compilers to improve the overall performance. However, this means that a just-in-time compiler has to be implemented for each language.

We explore the approach of taking an interpreter of a dynamic 
language and running it on top of an optimizing trace-based virtual machine, i.e., we run a guest {VM} on top of a host {VM.} The host {VM} uses trace recording to observe the guest {VM} executing the application program. Each recorded trace represents a sequence
of guest {VM} bytecodes corresponding to a given execution path
through the application program. The host {VM} optimizes and compiles these traces to machine code, thus eliminating the need for a custom just-in-time compiler for the guest {VM.} The guest {VM} only needs to provide basic  information about its interpreter loop to the
host {VM.}},

Our {SELF} implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite {SELF's} lack of classes and explicit variables. To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. To compensate for dynamic typing, user-defined control structures, and the lack of explicit variables, our system dynamically compiles multiple versions of a source method, each customized according to its receiver's map. Within each version the type of the receiver is fixed, and thus the compiler can statically bind and inline all messages sent to self. Message splitting and type prediction extract and preserve even more static type information, allowing the compiler to inline many other messages. Inlining dramatically improves performance and eliminates the need to hard-wire low-level methods such as +,==, and {ifTrue:.} Despite inlining and other optimizations, our system still supports interactive programming environments. The system traverses internal dependency lists to invalidate all compiled methods affected by a programming change. The debugger reconstructs inlined stack frames from compiler-generated debugging information, making inlining invisible to the {SELF} programmer.},

In the present paper, the Psyco prototype for the Python language is presented. It introduces two novel techniques. The first is just-in-time specialization, or specialization by need, which introduces the "unlifting" ability for a value to be promoted from run-time to compile-time during specialization -- the inverse of the lift operator of partial evaluation. Its presence gives an unusual and powerful perspective on the specialization process. The second technique is representations, a theory of data-oriented specialization generalizing the traditional specialization domains (i.e. the compile-time/run-time dichotomy).},

	abstract = {For domain specific languages, "scripting languages", dynamic languages, and for virtual machine-based languages, the most straightforward implementation strategy is to write an interpreter. A simple interpreter consists of a loop that fetches the next bytecode, dispatches to the routine handling that bytecode, then loops. There are many ways to improve upon this simple mechanism, but as long as the execution of the program is driven by a representation of the program other than as a stream of native instructions, there will be some "interpretive {overhead".There} is a long history of approaches to removing interpretive overhead from programming language implementations. In practice, what often happens is that, once an interpreted language becomes popular, pressure builds to improve performance until eventually a project is undertaken to implement a native Just In Time {(JIT)} compiler for the language. Implementing a {JIT} is usually a large effort, affects a significant part of the existing language implementation, and adds a significant amount of code and complexity to the overall code {base.In} this paper, we present an innovative approach that dynamically removes much of the interpreted overhead from language implementations, with minimal instrumentation of the original interpreter. While it does not give the performance improvements of hand-crafted native compilers, our system provides an appealing point on the language implementation spectrum.},
