...for maximum effect;
in truth less impressive
on usual programs
(but still)

gitdm
  - data mining tool
  - reads the output of
    ``git log``
  - generate kernel dev.
    statistics
  - ...3x

MyHDL: VHDL-like lang
written in Python
now competitive with
"real world" VHDL
and Verilog simulators
  - 6 to 12 times faster

Random largeish program:
  - depends on 3rd-party C
    extensions
  - may try to install
    them for pypy
  - (pypy setup.py install)
  - may or may not work

ai: jumped 3x last week
but in general, constant
slow(?) progress


<slides>

partially public. funded:
 - EU, EU countries
 - still open source
   "mindset" at its core

Open Source
 - not GPL
 - like CPython
 - intense discussion of
   about 15 seconds


<slides>

Java or .NET
 - large pieces of codes
   no direct control
 - designed and optimiz.
   for some class of
   languages != Python


<slides>

CPython 2.7 "deprecated"

PyPy 1.x won't be anytime
soon

future: support both
PyPy (2.x) and PyPy3
