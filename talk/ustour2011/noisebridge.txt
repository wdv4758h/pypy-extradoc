*PyPy mini-sprint*

On Satuday the 5th or March, and Sunday the 6th, from 10 a.m. until
whenever, there will be a PyPy mini-sprint hosted at Noisebridge.  For
those unfamiliar with the term Sprint -- a Sprint is a time when
developers of a project get together to collaborate intensely.
Sometimes the focus is to 'break the back' of some hard problem that
the project faces, but in this case the focus will be on introducing
people to the project in a hands-on, practical way.  PyPy is the
Python interpreter written in Python which you can read about here:
http://morepypy.blogspot.com/  Everybody is welcome.  The goal is to
show off and work on whatever parts of PyPy people are interested in.
Possible areas include, but are not limited to the Just-in-Time
Compiler, Garbage Collectors, Stackless Python, or the Python 2.7
language compatibility.  A sprint is the best way for would-be contributors
to get involved with the project.  Come and bring your laptop.

Note:  On Wednesday March the 2nd, at 16:15 Armin Rigo will be giving a talk
about PyPy at the Stanford EE Computer Systems Colloquium 
http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/winter-schedule-20102011.html , and
on Thursay March the 3rd at 18:00 he will give another public talk at Yelp,
706 Mission St 9th Floor, San Francisco, California.  While attending
these talks is in no way mandatory, they might be of interest to those
planning on attending the Mini Sprint.

We expect to have between 6 and 12 people at this Sprint, but it is
possible that we will have many more.  We need wireless access,
electricity, chairs and tables which are set up so that we can
pair-program, a whiteboard, and some flat surface where we can use a
projector.  We have our own projector.
