Kill -1: process refactoring in the PyPy project
=================================================

In this talk we will present the experiences of running a collaborative
OSS project within a EU-funded consortium structure. We will briefly present 
the initial decision process for integrating the community and the commercial 
aspects of the PyPy project. We will show how agile practices within the 
development team, primarily sprint-driven methodology resulted in a need for 
process refactoring and how a new agile management approach was 
implemented. We will spice up the analysis of the main drivers behind this 
change by refererring to Hershey-Blanchards Situational Leadership model.
