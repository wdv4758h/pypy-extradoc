Abstract
--------

This talk describes novel features of the PyPy project (a next
generation Python interpreter) which are made possible by
its flexible architecture. The talk focuses mostly on example
usages and less about their implementation.  Specifically we 
will discuss and showcase the following:

 - lazy evaluation with the thunk object space
 - lightweight threadlets similar to what stackless python provides
 - Oz-like dataflow variables with the logic object space
 - Writing compatible extension modules for PyPy and CPython with the PyPy
   extension compiler
 - The Javascript backend and its uses
