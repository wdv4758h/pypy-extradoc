we had a bit of a chat in the pypy-sync meeting on 2006-05-18 about the talks
we want to give at europython this year.  we decided that we might give up to 4
talks:

    1. an introductory talk, probably based on michael's talk from the accu
       conference (but likely a bit shorter)
       Michael Hudson 

    2. a "what pypy can do for you" talk, covering the ext-compiler, stackless,
       etc.
       
       Armin Rigo, Carl Friedrich Bolz 

    3. an architecture session, similar to that held at pycon this year.
       Samuele Pedroni, Holger Krekel 

    4. a talk on the methodology side of the project.
       Bea During

In addition Eric will probably give a lightning talk about the JS backend.
