---- pypy 3000 ----

+++ single language specification written in (R)Python 

++ equally runs on/translates to C, .NET and Java platforms

+ and squeak/smalltalk

- and common lisp :)

+ includes JIT compiler for C ...

- ... and for javascript/Internet Explorer 

+ currently pypy gets faster 4 times each year ...

- clearly means: will be 200 times faster than CPython 3000!

+ write and test AJAX apps in python, translate to Javascript 

- or simply have pygame run and translated into browsers 

- select python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3000 ... (syntax) features per module

+ transparent distribution of objects/execution across machines 

+ data tagging security models 

- sandbox security models 

- transparent persistence 

++ logic variables / prolog like features

++ coroutines / greenlets / tasklets 

+ "build your own PyPy"

++ lazy types/computations

+ runtime modifiable syntax (or better not? :)

-- FPGA backend (python programs translated to hardware)

+ secret goal: run Bub'n'Bros on every possible platform 

++ summer of pypy: if you are a student and want it to happen: contact us!
