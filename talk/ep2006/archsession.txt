Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

XXX DRAFT 

In this session we will present and interactively discuss with
the audience the basic architectural pictures of PyPy - a next
generation Python compiler and interpreter.  We will emphasize 
emphasize various emerging possibilities enabled by our
architecture and ask the audience for questions. 

In particular, we'll describe the following architectural pictures 
and point out extension and optimization possibilities: 

- Language Implementation: Bytecode Interpreter and Object Space interaction
- Translation to low level languages (e.g. C/LLVM)
- Translation to higher level languages (e.g. .NET/Squeak) 
- JIT-compiler architecture 
- Interweaving of Garbage Collection, threading and stackless
  operations into the translation process 

Intended audience
-----------------

Python programmers and people interested in the general picture
of the PyPy code base.
