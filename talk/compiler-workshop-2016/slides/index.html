                        <h1>What We Bring to the Table</h1>
                        Our core is based on cutting-edge JIT compiler
                        research, written in Python.

                        <h1>Written in Python</h1>
                        Being written in Python means we can quickly
                        try out (and reject or incorporate) new ideas.
                        For instance, our STM work has
                        uncovered subtle bugs in CLANG and GCC, or the fact that we can easily try out
                        new register allocation strategies.

                        We are also working on Micro NumPy, which provides the kernels for numerical operations.
                        It is very usable, but still some features are missing. We would love to have a
                        partner/company that would help us to complete NumPy for PyPy.
