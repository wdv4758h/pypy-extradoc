Optimizing Python programs, PyPy to the rescue
==============================================

In this talk I want to show how you can use PyPy for your benefit.
It will kick off with a short introduction covering PyPy and its just in time
compiler. PyPy is the most advanced Python interpreter around
and while it should generally just speed up your programs there is a wide range
of performance that you can get out of PyPy.

The first part, will cover considerations why one should write Python programs,
and only spend fractions of the development time to optimize your program.
The second part of this session will be about this small part
of time: in cases where you need it, then I'll show tools that help you inspect
and change your program to improve it. We will also dive into one tool more elaboratly.
VMProf, a platform to inspect your program while it is running, imposing very little overhead.

Throughout the talk real world examples will motivate why PyPy is a viable option
to optimize you Python programs and present the examples' value to their developers.

As a result of this talk, an audience member should be equipped with
tools that helps him to understand and optimize programs.
