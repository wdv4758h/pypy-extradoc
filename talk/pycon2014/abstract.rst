Software Transactional Memory with PyPy
=======================================

Description
-----------

PyPy is a fast alternative Python implementation.  Software
Transactional Memory is a current academic research topic.  Put the two
together --brew for a couple of years-- and we obtain a version of PyPy
that runs on multiple cores, without the infamous Global Interpreter
Lock (GIL).  It has been freshly released in beta, including integration
with the Just-in-Time compiler.

The talk will also include a "general status of PyPy" part.
