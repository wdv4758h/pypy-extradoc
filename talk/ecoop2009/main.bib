	abstract = {We present a just-in-time compiler for a Java VM that is small enough to fit on resource-constrained devices, yet is surprisingly effective. Our system dynamically identifies traces of frequently executed bytecode instructions (which may span several basic blocks across several methods) and compiles them via Static Single Assignment (SSA) construction. Our novel use of SSA form in this context allows to hoist instructions across trace side-exits without necessitating expensive compensation code in off-trace paths. The overall memory consumption (code and data) of our system is only 150 kBytes, yet benchmarks show a speedup that in some cases rivals heavy-weight just-in-time compilers.},

We have explored trace-based compilation, in which the unit of compilation is a loop, potentially spanning multiple methods and even library code. Using a new intermediate representation that is discovered and updated lazily on-demand while the program is being executed, our compiler generates code that is competitive with traditional dynamic compilers, but that uses only a fraction of the compile time and memory footprint.},

Via Code Specialization Using Precise Runtime Type Inference},
	abstract = {Dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript present a challenge to just-in-time compilers. In contrast to statically typed languages such as JVML, in which there are specific opcodes for common operations on primitive types (such as iadd for integer addition), all operations in dynamically typed language such as JavaScript are late-bound. Often enough, types cannot be inferred with certainty ahead of execution. As a result, just-in-time compilers for dynamically typed languages have tended to perform worse than their statically-typed counterparts. We present a new approach to compiling dynamically typed languages in which code traces observed during execution are dynamically specialized for each actually observed run-time type. For most benchmark programs, our prototype JavaScript virtual machine outperforms every other JavaScript platform known to us.},

 title = {{How to not write Virtual Machines for Dynamic Languages 
}},
 booktitle = {Proceeding of Dyla 2007 (to appear)},
 abstract = {Typical modern dynamic languages have a growing number of
                  implementations. We explore the reasons for this situation,
                  and the limitations it imposes on open source or academic
                  communities that lack the resources to fine-tune and
                  maintain them all. It is sometimes proposed that
                  implementing dynamic languages on top of a standardized
                  general-purpose ob ject-oriented virtual machine (like Java
                  or .NET) would help reduce this burden. We propose a
                  complementary alternative to writing custom virtual machine
                  (VMs) by hand, validated by the PyPy pro ject: flexibly
                  generating VMs from a high-level specification, inserting
                  features and low-level details automatically – including
                  good just-in-time compilers tuned to the dynamic language at
                  hand.  We believe this to be ultimately a better investment
                  of efforts than the development of more and more advanced
                  general-purpose object oriented VMs. In this paper we
                  compare these two approaches in detail.},
