 abstract = {Typical modern dynamic languages have a growing number of
                  implementations. We explore the reasons for this situation,
                  and the limitations it imposes on open source or academic
                  communities that lack the resources to fine-tune and
                  maintain them all. It is sometimes proposed that
                  implementing dynamic languages on top of a standardized
                  general-purpose object-oriented virtual machine (like Java
                  or .NET) would help reduce this burden. We propose a
                  complementary alternative to writing custom virtual machine
                  (VMs) by hand, validated by the PyPy project: flexibly
                  generating VMs from a high-level specification, inserting
                  features and low-level details automatically â€“ including
                  good just-in-time compilers tuned to the dynamic language at
                  hand.  We believe this to be ultimately a better investment
                  of efforts than the development of more and more advanced
                  general-purpose object oriented VMs. In this paper we
                  compare these two approaches in detail.},
