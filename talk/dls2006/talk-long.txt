PyPy's VM Approach
=================================================

PyPy
========================

- Python VM implementation
  in Python (a well-chosen subset)
- A translation tool-chain
- Open source project (MIT license)

VMs are still hard
========================

It is hard to achieve:

- flexibility
- maintainability
- performance (needs
  dynamic compilation techniques)

Especially with limited resources.


Python Case
===================================

CPython is a straightforward,
portable VM.

- Some decisions are pervasive:
  reference counting, single global lock ...

- No dynamic compilation.
  Performance is limited.


- Extensions:

  * *Stackless* (heap-bound recursion,
    coroutines, serializable continuations)

  * *Psyco* (run-time specializer,
    interesting results)


Python Case (ii)
===================================

- Extensions...

  ... need to keep track and are hard to maintain.
  Hard to port Psyco to other architectures.

- The community wants Python to run everywhere:
  Jython (Java), IronPython (.NET).
  Lots of effort and duplication.

PyPy's approach
=================================

*Goal: generate VMs from a single
high-level description of the language,
in a retargettable way.*

- Write an interpreter for a dynamic language (Python)
  in a high-level language (Python)

- Leave out low-level details, favour simplicity
  and flexibility

- Define a mapping to low-level targets, generating
  VMs from the interpreter

Mapping to low-level targets
===============================

- Mechanically translate the interpreter to multiple
  lower-level targets (C-like, Java, .NET...)

- Insert low-level aspects into the code as required by
  the target (object layout, memory management...)

- Optionally insert new pervasive features not expressed
  in the source (continuations, specialization abilities...)

Status of the project
==========================

Fully compliant interpreter, translatable to C,
LLVM and the CLR.

Maintainability: following the (fast-paced)
language evolution is very easy.

Flexibility: we were able to reimplement
Stackless features without extensive
changes to the baseline interpreter

Performance: work in-progress,
2.3 times slower than CPython
without dynamic compilation (current goal)

... and many experiments at various levels

Translation approach
==========================

* Refine a subset of your favourite
  language (e.g. Python) amenable
  to analysis but expressive enough 
  to write interpreters in it.

* Write a translation tool-chain
  from this subset ("RPython")
  to multiple targets (C-like, .NET, etc.)

* The translation tool-chain should
  implement (and be configurable to 
  be) a good mapping from the interpreter
  to reasonably efficient implementations for 
  the various targets.

Type Inference
=================

- based on abstract interpretation

- fix-point forward propagation

- extensible

Targets as Type Systems
========================

- RPython types (lists, strings, dicts, instances and classes...)
  may be too high-level for the target (e.g. in C, structs and pointers)

- approach: reflect the essential aspects
  of a target as a custom type system
  into RPython (e.g. C-like types)

::

    STR = GcStruct('rpy_string',
                      ('hash', Signed),
                      ('chars', Array(Char)))

Targets as Type Systems (ii)
================================
  
- implement a simulation
  of the types in normal Python,
  allowing code like this to run::

    def ll_char_mul(char, length):
        newstr = malloc(STR, length)
        newstr.hash = 0
        for i in range(length):
            newstr.chars[i] = char
        return newstr


Targets as Type Systems (iii)
===============================

- extend the type inferencer
  to understand usages of these types

- use the type system
  to express how regular, high-level RPython types
  should be represented 
  at the level of the target

- write implementation "helper" code (e.g. ``ll_char_mul``)
  which is again RPython and can be type inferenced
  and translated

Translation Aspects
=====================

*Features not present in the source can be
added during translation:*

- memory management (Boehm, or reference counting
  by transforming all control flow graphs, or our own
  GCs - themselves written within the same framework as the
  RPython "helper" code)

.. GC Pressure blues

Translation Aspects (ii)
==========================

- continuation capture, implemented by saving the low-level
  frames' local variables into the heap and back

- work in progress: turning an interpreter into a compiler
  is a translation aspect too (based on binding-time analysis
  and partial evaluation, extended to use the techniques of
  Psyco)

Translation Summary
===========================

*The translation tool-chain
has proved effective:*

- low-level details and
  pervasive decision can be
  left out of the interpreter

- it can targets at the same time:
  C, LLVM, the CLR
  and is open for further backends (JVM in progress)

- it can and has been used
  in the context of other research
  projects and spin-off ideas
  (e.g. a JavaScript backend,
  compilation of other RPython programs...)

Run-time Specialization
========================

Previous experience: Psyco

- a "just-in-time specializer" which can transparently
  accelerate user code

- a C hand-written "generating extension", in the terminology
  of partial evaluation

- similar to conventional JITs with the additional ability
  to suspend compilation at any point, and wait for actual
  run-time information (e.g. type of an object):
  **promotion**.

A Specializer as an Aspect
==========================================

General idea (the devil is in the details):

- Transform the flowgraphs of the interpreter
  into a compiler, using the type inference
  framework to do binding-time analysis (runtime/
  compile-time) based on a few hints.

- Special hints to insert and control promotion.

- We think that promotion is the key to making
  it practical for large interpreters and complex
  semantics.

This is what we are working on right now.

Self-hosted JITs
===========================

- they work: Jikes VM
- the language semantics need to
  be captured into a good compiler
- good means the resulting VM
  should be fast enough
- target hardware CPUs
- lots of effort still, and hard
  to reuse for another language

Target platform VMs (JVM, CLR)
==============================

- semantics mismatch (e.g.
  lookup) can result in speed penalty
  or unnatural code

- how to obliviously layer dynamic
  compilation on top of a JIT
  is effectively an open problem

- urge to tweak the underlying VM

- coding in Java, C#: not expressive
  enough, same risks of inflexibility,
  hard to revert pervasive decisions

Open Virtual Machines
==========================

Reconfigurable at run time to run 
specific languages.

- Open research area.

- Large design space.

- What are the best primitives?

- Likely same trade-offs in
  more acute form: need sharp tools.

GC Pressure
======================

RPython is still a garbage collected language.

Large allocation rate from interpreter objects
(boxes, frames) but easily temporary objects
too.

Good allocation removal optimizations
and memory management very much needed.
