This directory contains the PyPy presentation from 
Pycon 2005 in Washington DC.  The ppresentation requires 
Python and Pygame to run.  See http://www.pygame.org/ 
on how to install Pygame on your system.  Then 
perform the equivalent of: 

    svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/talk/pypy-talk-pycon2005

And then run:: 

    python ep.py 

you can then hit the `space` key to move forward in the 
animated presentation.  This is only tested on linux, 
but it should hopefully work on other platforms.
