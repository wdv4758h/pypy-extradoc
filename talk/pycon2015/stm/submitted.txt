Detailed Abstract

... Include links to source code, articles, blog posts, or other writing that adds context to the presentation.

Outline
... Your outline should be an enumeration of what you intend to say, along with time estimates.

Additional notes
...Anything else you'd like the program committee to know when making their selection: your past speaking experience, open source community experience, etc.
... If you've given a talk, tutorial, or other presentation before, especially at an earlier PyCon or another conference, include that information as well as a link to slides or a video if they're available.

Additional requirements
...Please let us know if you have any specific needs (A/V requirements, multiple microphones, a table, etc). Note for example that 'audio out' is not provided for your computer unless you tell us in advance.

Recording release
...By submitting your talk proposal, you agree to give permission to the Python Software Foundation to record, edit, and release audio and/or video of your presentation. If you do not agree to this, please uncheck this box. See PyCon 2015 Recording Release for details.
