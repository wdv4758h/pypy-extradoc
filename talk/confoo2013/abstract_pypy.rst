PyPy - the fastest Python interpreter
=============================================

The PyPy project has recently gathered a lot of attention for its
progress in speeding up the Python language -- it is the fastest,
most compatible and most stable 'alternative´ Python interpreter.  No
longer merely a research curiosity, PyPy is now suitable for production
use. I would like to present PyPy, its current status, near future goals
and the general performance Python landscape.

NOTES TO ORGANIZERS:

I've been PyPy core developer since 2006 and presenting PyPy to wider audience
since 2007. I've been to conferences all over the world, speaking about PyPy
and other Python topics. This talk will hopefully introduce the conference
audience to what PyPy is, how to use it in your code and what benefits can
you expect.
