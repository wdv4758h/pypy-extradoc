PyPy: status and mobile perspectives 
-----------------------------------------

This talk will discuss the new PyPy Python implementation with
respect to RAM usage, startup time and speed.  Numbers are
taken from the recent port to the Maemo platform.  We'll 
assess compliancy and features of the imminent 1.1 release, 
and about its unique sandboxing and OS-virtualization features. 
Eventually we present and discuss next steps for making it a
replacement for CPython and for extending Python usage on 
mobile phones in general.
