====================
PyPy without the GIL
====================

Intro
---------------------------

- PyPy intro

- thanks to contributors for STM


Problem
-------

* An existing complex, large program that does stuff

* "stuff" consists of bits that are mostly independent from each other

|pause|

* ... but not quite


Problem
-------

* We want to parallelize the program to use all these cores

* We have some shared mutable state

|pause|

* Not too much of it --- otherwise, no chance for parallelism

* But still some


Classic solutions
-----------------

Bare-metal multi-threading:

* large shared state

* needs careful usage of locks

* mostly hindered by the GIL in CPython
  (but not in Jython or IronPython)


Classic solutions
-----------------

Multi-processing:

* no shared mutable state at all

* copying, keeping in sync is your problem

* serializing and deserializing is expensive and hard

* memory usage is often multiplied (unless you're lucky with ``fork``,
  but not on Python)


Classic solutions
-----------------

A range of intermediate solutions:

* MPI: message passing, with limited shared state

* etc.: tons of experiments that never caught on in the mainstream


Classic solutions
-----------------

The typical solution for web servers:

* run independent processes

* share data only via the database

* the database itself handles concurrency with transactions


Demo
----

* ``pypy-stm``

* internally based on "transactions" (STM, HTM)


Demo
----

- demo: 

  * multithreading.py

  * multithreading2.py

  * message_passing.py

  * transactions2.py

Status of the implementation
----------------------------

* mostly works

* major GC collections missing (leaks slowly)

* JIT integration is not done

* tons of optimizations possible

How do I use it?
----------------

* just like with the GIL

* ``__pypy__.thread.atomic``

::
    with atomic:
         print "hello", username

* the illusion of serialization

STM - low level
---------------

* STM = Software Transactional Memory

* Basic idea: each thread runs in parallel, but everything it does is
  in a series of "transactions"

* A transaction keeps all changes to pre-existing memory "local"


* The changes are made visible only when the transaction "commits"

STM - low level (2)
-------------------

* The transaction will "abort" if a conflict is detected, and
  it will be transparently retried


* Non-reversible operations like I/O turn the transaction "inevitable"
  and stop progress in the other threads


* __pypy__.thread.last_abort_info() -> traceback-like information

Alternative - HTM
-----------------

XXX

Higher level: not threads
---------------------------

- based on (and fully compatible with) threads

  * existing multithreaded programs work


- but opens up unexpected alternatives

  * we can run multiple threads but at the same time use ``atomic``

  * with the GIL-based idea of ``atomic`` it doesn't make sense:
    we have multiple threads but they're all using ``atomic``, i.e.
    only one at a time will ever run...  except no :-)




- xxx memory usage good




- transaction.py

  * demo

  * illusion of serial execution: can "sanely" reason about algorithms

  * "Conflict tracebacks"

  * Might need to debug them --- but they are performance bugs, not
    correctness bugs

  * The idea is that we fix only XX% of the bugs and we are done

  * Maybe some new "performance debugger" tools might help too


- TigerQuoll, 1st March: same idea with JavaScript (for servers)

  * various models possible:

    . events dispatchers

    . futures

    . map/reduce, scatter/gather


Event dispatchers
-----------------

* twisted, tulip, etc.

* run the event dispatcher in one thread (e.g. the main thread),
  and schedule the actual events to run on a different thread from
  a pool

* the events are run with ``atomic``, so that they appear to run
  serially

* does not rely on any change to the user program

Donate!
-------

* STM is primarily funded by donations

* We got quite far with $22k USD

* Thanks to the PSF and all others!

* We need your help too
