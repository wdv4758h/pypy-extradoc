	abstract = {We introduce a just-in-time specializer for Prolog. Just-in-
time specialization attempts to unify of the concepts and benefits of
partial evaluation {(PE)} and just-in-time {(JIT)} compilation. It is a variant
of {PE} that occurs purely at runtime, which lazily generates residual code
and is constantly driven by runtime feedback.
Our prototype is an on-line just-in-time partial evaluator. A major fo-
cus of our work is to remove the overhead incurred when executing an
interpreter written in Prolog. It improves over classical offline {PE} by re-
quiring almost no heuristics nor hints from the author of the interpreter;
it also avoids most termination issues due to interleaving execution and
specialization. We evaluate the performance of our prototype on a small
number of benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Most Prolog implementations are implemented in low-level languages such as C and are based on a variation of the {WAM} instruction set, which enhances their performance but makes them hard to write. In addition, many of the more dynamic features of Prolog (like assert), despite their popularity, are not well supported. We present a high-level continuation-based Prolog interpreter based on the {PyPy} project. The {PyPy} project makes it possible to easily and efficiently implement dynamic languages. It provides tools that automatically generate a just-in-time compiler for a given interpreter of the target language, by using partial evaluation techniques. The resulting Prolog implementation is surprisingly efficient: it clearly outperforms existing interpreters of Prolog in high-level languages such as Java. Moreover, on some benchmarks, our system outperforms state-of-the-art {WAM-based} Prolog implementations. Our paper aims to show that declarative languages such as Prolog can indeed benefit from having a just-in-time compiler and that {PyPy} can form the basis for implementing programming languages other than Python.},

Thus, the programming model implements a virtual shared address space.

{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recently,} I've become aware of the {\textless}a {href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/spur/"{\textgreater}SPUR} project{\textless}/a{\textgreater} of Microsoft Research and read some of their papers (the tech report {"SPUR:} A {Trace-Based} {JIT} Compiler for {CIL"} is very cool). I found the project to be very interesting and since their approach is in many ways related to what {PyPy} is doing, I now want to compare and contrast the two projects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{{\textless}h2{\textgreater}A} Tracing {JIT} for {.NET{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}SPUR} consist of two parts: On the one hand it is a {VM} for {CIL,} the bytecode of the {.NET} {VM.} This {VM} uses a tracing {JIT} compiler to compile the programs it is running to machine code. As opposed to most existing {VMs} that have a tracing {JIT} it does not use an interpreter at all. Instead it contains various variants of a {JIT} compiler that produce different versions of each method. Those are:{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}ul{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}a {\textless}em{\textgreater}profiling {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} which produces code that does lightweight profiling when running the compiled method{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}a {\textless}em{\textgreater}tracing {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} which produces code that produces a trace when running the compiled method{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}a {\textless}em{\textgreater}transfer-tail {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} which is used to produce code which is run to get from a failing guard back to the normal profiling version of a method{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}an {\textless}em{\textgreater}optimizing {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} that actually optimizes traces and turns them into machine code{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}/ul{\textgreater}
{\textless}div id="optimizations-done-by-the-optimizing-jit"{\textgreater}
{{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Optimizations} Done by the Optimizing {JIT{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}SPUR's} optimizing {JIT} does a number of powerful optimizations on the traces before it turns them into machine code. Among them are usual compiler optimizations such as register allocation, common subexpression elimination, loop invariant code motion, etc.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}It} also performs some optimizations that are specific to the tracing context and are thus not commonly found in "normal" compilers:{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}ul{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}guard implication{\textless}/em{\textgreater}: if a guard is implied by an earlier guard, it is removed{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}guard strengthening{\textless}/em{\textgreater}: if there is a sequence of guards that become stronger and stronger (i.e. each guard implies the previous one), the first guard in the sequence is replaced by the last one, and all others are removed. This can greatly reduce the number of guards and is generally safe. It can shift a guard failure to an earlier point in the trace, but the failure would have occurred at some point in the trace anyway.{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}load/store optimizations{\textless}/em{\textgreater}: this is an optimization for memory reads/writes. If several loads from the same memory location occur without writes in between, all but the first one are removed. Similarly, if a write to a memory location is performed, this write is delayed as much as possible. If there is a write to the same location soon afterwards, the first write can be removed.{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}escape analysis{\textless}/em{\textgreater}: for allocations that occur in a loop, the optimizer checks whether the resulting object escapes the loop. If not, the allocation is moved before the loop, so that only one object needs to be allocated, instead of one every loop iteration.{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}user-controlled loop unrolling{\textless}/em{\textgreater}: not exactly an optimization, but an interesting feature anyway. It is possible to annotate a {CIL} method with a special decorator {{\textless}tt{\textgreater}[TraceUnfold]{\textless}/tt{\textgreater}} and then the tracing {JIT} will fully unroll the loops it contains. This can be useful for loops than are known to run a small and fixed number of iterations for each call-site.{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}user controlled tracing{\textless}/em{\textgreater}: The user can also control tracing up to a point. Methods can be annotated with {{\textless}tt{\textgreater}[NativeCall]{\textless}/tt{\textgreater}} to tell the tracer to never trace their execution. Instead they appear as a direct call in the trace.{\textless}/li{\textgreater}

{\textless}div id="a-javascript-implementation"{\textgreater}
{{\textless}h2{\textgreater}A} {JavaScript} Implementation{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}In} addition to the tracing {JIT} I just described, {SPUR} also contains a {JavaScript} implementation for {.NET.} The approach of this implementation is to translate {JavaScript} to {CIL} bytecode, doing some amount of type inference to detect variables that have fixed types. All operations where no precise type could be determined are implemented with calls to a {JavaScript} runtime system, which does the necessary type dispatching. The {JavaScript} runtime is implemented in C\#.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}The} {JavaScript} implementation and the {CLI} {VM} with a tracing {JIT} sound quite unrelated at first, but together they amplify each other. The tracing {JIT} traces the {JavaScript} functions that have been translated to {CLI} bytecode. Since the {JavaScript} runtime is in C\#, it exists as {CLI} bytecode too. Thus it can be inlined into the {JavaScript} functions by the tracer. This is highly beneficial, since it exposes the runtime type dispatching of the {JavaScript} operations to the optimizations of the tracing {JIT.} Particularly the common expression elimination helps the {JavaScript} code. If a series of operations is performed on the same object, the operations will all do the same type checks. All but the type checks of the first operation can be removed by the optimizer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}div id="performance-results"{\textgreater}
{{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Performance} Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}The} speed results of the combined {JavaScript} implementation and tracing {JIT} are quite impressive. It beats {TraceMonkey} for most benchmarks in {SunSpider} (apart from some string-heavy benchmarks that are quite slow) and can compete with V8 in many of them. However, all this is steady-state performance and it seems {SPUR's} compile time is rather bad currently.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}/div{\textgreater}
{\textless}div id="further-possibilities"{\textgreater}
{{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Further} Possibilities{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}A} further (so far still hypothetical) advantage of {SPUR} is that the approach can optimize cases where execution crosses the border of two different systems. If somebody wrote an {HTML} layout engine and a {DOM} in C\# to get a web browser and integrated it with the {JavaScript} implementation described above, the tracing {JIT} could optimize {DOM} manipulations performed by {JavaScript} code as well as callbacks from the browser into {JavaScript} code.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Of} course the approach {SPUR} takes to implement {JavaScript} is completely generalizable. It should be possible to implement other dynamic languages in the same way as {JavaScript} using {SPUR.} One would have to write a runtime system for the language in C\#, as well as a compiler from the language into {CIL} bytecode. Given these two elements, {SPUR's} tracing {JIT} compiler would probably do a reasonable job at optimizing this other language (of course in practise, the language implementation would need some tweaking and annotations to make it really fast).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}/div{\textgreater}
{\textless}/div{\textgreater}
{\textless}div id="comparison-with-pypy"{\textgreater}
{{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Comparison} With {PyPy{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}The} goals of {PyPy} and {SPUR} are very similar. Both projects want to implement dynamic languages in an efficient way by using a tracing {JIT.} Both apply the tracing {JIT} "one level down", i.e. the runtime system of the dynamic language is visible to the tracing {JIT.} This is the crucial point of the approach of both projects. Since the runtime system of the dynamic language is visible to the tracing {JIT,} the {JIT} can optimize programs in that dynamic language. It does not itself need to know about the semantics of the dynamic language. This makes the tracing {JIT} usable for a variety of dynamic languages. It also means that the two halves can be implemented and debugged independently.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}In} {SPUR,} C\# (or another language that is compilable to {CIL)} plays the role of {RPython,} and {CIL} is equivalent to the intermediate format that {PyPy's} translation toolchain uses. Both formats operate on a similar abstraction level, they are quite close to C, but still have support for the object system of their respective language and are garbage-collected.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}SPUR} supports only a {JavaScript} implementation so far, which could maybe change in the future. Thus {JavaScript} in {SPUR} corresponds to Python in {PyPy,} which was the first dynamic language implemented in {PyPy} (and is also the reason for {PyPy's} existence).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}There} are obviously also differences between the two projects, although many of them are only skin-deep. The largest difference is the reliance of {SPUR} on compilers on all levels. {PyPy} takes the opposite approach of using interpreters almost everywhere. The parts of {PyPy} that correspond to {SPUR's} compilers are {(I} will use the Python implementation of {PyPy} as an example):{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}ul{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}the {{\textless}em{\textgreater}JavaScript-to-CIL} compiler{\textless}/em{\textgreater} corresponds to the Python interpreter of {PyPy{\textless}/li{\textgreater}}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}the {\textless}em{\textgreater}profiling {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} corresponds to a part of {PyPy's} translation toolchain which adds some profiling support in the process of turning {RPython} code into C code,{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}the {\textless}em{\textgreater}tracing {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} corresponds to a special interpreter in the {PyPy} {JIT} which executes an {RPython} program and produces a trace of the execution{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}the {\textless}em{\textgreater}transfer-tail {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} corresponds to {PyPy's} {\textless}a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2010/06/blackhole-interpreter.html"{\textgreater}blackhole interpreter{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, also called fallback interpreter{\textless}/li{\textgreater}
{\textless}li{\textgreater}the {\textless}em{\textgreater}optimizing {JIT{\textless}/em{\textgreater}} corresponds to the optimizers and backends of {PyPy's} {JIT{\textless}/li{\textgreater}}
{\textless}/ul{\textgreater}
{\textless}div id="pypy-s-optimizations"{\textgreater}
{{\textless}h3{\textgreater}PyPy's} Optimizations{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Comparing} the optimizations that the two projects perform, the biggest difference is that {PyPy} does "trace stitching" instead of fully supporting trace trees. The difference between the two concerns what happens when a new trace gets added to an existing loop. The new trace starts from a guard in the existing loop that was observed to fail often. Trace stitching means that the loop is just patched with a jump to the new trace. {SPUR} instead recompiles the whole trace tree, which gives the optimizers more opportunities, but also makes compilation a lot slower. Another difference is that {PyPy} does not perform loop-invariant code motion yet.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many} of the remaining optimizations are very similar. {PyPy} supports guard implication as well as guard strengthening. It has some load/store optimizations, but {PyPy's} alias analysis is quite rudimentary. On the other hand, {PyPy's} escape analysis is very powerful. {PyPy} also has support for the annotations that {SPUR} supports, using some decorators in the {\textless}tt{\textgreater}pypy.rlib.jit{\textless}/tt{\textgreater} module. User-controlled loop unrolling is performed using the {\textless}tt{\textgreater}unroll\_safe{\textless}/tt{\textgreater} decorator, tracing of a function can be disabled with the {\textless}tt{\textgreater}dont\_look\_inside{\textless}/tt{\textgreater} decorator.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}PyPy} has a few more annotations that were not mentioned in the {SPUR} tech report. Most importantly, it is possible to declare a function as pure, using the {\textless}tt{\textgreater}purefunction{\textless}/tt{\textgreater} decorator. {PyPy's} optimizers will remove calls to a function decorated that way if the arguments to the call are all constant. In addition it is possible to declare instances of classes to be immutable, which means that field accesses on constant instances can be folded away. Furthermore there is the promote hint, which is spelled {\textless}tt{\textgreater}x = hint(x, {promote=True){\textless}/tt{\textgreater}.} This will produce a guard in the trace, to turn {\textless}tt{\textgreater}x{\textless}/tt{\textgreater} into a constant after the guard.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Given} the similarity between the projects' goals, it is perhaps not so surprising to see that {PyPy} and {SPUR} have co-evolved and reached many similar design decisions. It is still very good to see another project that does many things in the same way as {PyPy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}}

The aim is to translate (i.e. compile) the {VM} to arbitrary target environments, ranging in level from {C/Posix} to {Smalltalk/Squeak} via Java and {CLI/.NET,} while still being of reasonable efficiency within these {environments.A} key tool to achieve this goal is the systematic reuse of the Python language as a system programming language at various levels of our architecture and translation process. For each level, we design a corresponding type system and apply a generic type inference engine - for example, the garbage collector is written in a style that manipulates simulated pointer and address objects, and when translated to C these operations become C-level pointer and address instructions.},

Tracing {JIT} compilers can greatly speed up programs that spend most of their time in loops in which they take similar code paths. However, applying an unmodified tracing {JIT} to a program that is itself a bytecode interpreter results in very limited or no speedup. In this paper we show how to guide tracing {JIT} compilers to greatly improve the speed of bytecode interpreters. One crucial point is to unroll the bytecode dispatch loop, based on two kinds of hints provided by the implementer of the bytecode interpreter. We evaluate our technique by applying it to two {PyPy} interpreters: one is a small example, and the other one is the full Python interpreter.},

Our novel use of {SSA} form in this context allows to hoist instructions across trace side-exits without necessitating expensive compensation code in off-trace paths. The overall memory consumption (code and data) of our system is only 150 {kBytes,} yet benchmarks show a speedup that in some cases rivals heavy-weight just-in-time compilers.},

	abstract = {Typical modern dynamic languages have a growing number of implementations. We explore the reasons for this situation, and the limitations it imposes on open source or academic communities that lack the resources to fine-tune and maintain them all. It is sometimes proposed that implementing dynamic languages on top of a standardized general-purpose object-oriented virtual machine (like Java or {.NET)} would help reduce this burden. We propose a complementary alternative to writing custom virtual machine {(VMs)} by hand, validated by the {PyPy} project: flexibly generating {VMs} from a high-level "specification",
inserting features and low-level details automatically {\textendash} including good just-in-time compilers tuned to the dynamic language at hand.
We believe this to be ultimately a better investment of efforts than the development of more and more advanced general-purpose object
oriented {VMs.} In this paper we compare these two approaches in detail.},

This approach is only moderately successful with very high level languages, where the operation of each single step can be highly dependent on run-time data and context. In the present paper, the Psyco prototype for the Python language is presented. It introduces two novel techniques. The first is just-in-time specialization, or specialization by need, which introduces the "unlifting" ability for a value to be promoted from run-time to compile-time during specialization -- the inverse of the lift operator of partial evaluation. Its presence gives an unusual and powerful perspective on the specialization process. The second technique is representations, a theory of data-oriented specialization generalizing the traditional specialization domains (i.e. the compile-time/run-time dichotomy).},

Spy is a re-implementation of the Squeak (i.e. Smalltalk-80) {VM} using the {PyPy} toolchain. The {PyPy} project allows code written in {RPython,} a subset of Python, to be translated
to a multitude of different backends and architectures. During the translation, many aspects of the implementation can be
independently tuned, such as the garbage collection algorithm or threading implementation. In this way, a whole host of interpreters
can be derived from one abstract interpreter definition. Spy aims to bring these benefits to Squeak, allowing for greater portability and, eventually, improved performance. The current
Spy codebase is able to run a small set of benchmarks that demonstrate performance superior to many similar Smalltalk {VMs,} but
which still run slower than in Squeak itself. Spy was built from scratch over the course of a week during a joint {Squeak-PyPy} Sprint in Bern last autumn.},
