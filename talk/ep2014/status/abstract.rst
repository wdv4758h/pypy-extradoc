PyPy status talk (a.k.a.: no no, PyPy is not dead)
===================================================

In this talk we will present the current status of PyPy, with a particular
focus on what happened in the last two years, since the last EuroPython PyPy
talk.  We will give a brief overview of the current speed and the on-going
development efforts, including but not limited to:

- the status of the JIT and PyPy performance in general

- the improvements on the Garbage Collector

- the status of numpy and Python 3 compatibility

- the status and ideas of the STM (Software Transactional Memory) research
  project, which aims to solve the GIL problem
