	abstract = {The Smalltalk-80* programming language includes dynamic storage allocation, full upward funargs, and universally polymorphic procedures; the Smalltalk-80 programming system features interactive execution with incremental compilation, and implementation portability. These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually. A new implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete (object code) compatibility with existing implementations. This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages. The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.},

	abstract = {Most Prolog implementations are implemented in low-level languages such as C and are based on a variation of the {WAM} instruction set, which enhances their performance but makes them hard to write. In addition, many of the more dynamic features of Prolog (like assert), despite their popularity, are not well supported. We present a high-level continuation-based Prolog interpreter based on the {PyPy} project. The {PyPy} project makes it possible to easily and efficiently implement dynamic languages. It provides tools that automatically generate a just-in-time compiler for a given interpreter of the target language, by using partial evaluation techniques. The resulting Prolog implementation is surprisingly efficient: it clearly outperforms existing interpreters of Prolog in high-level languages such as Java. Moreover, on some benchmarks, our system outperforms state-of-the-art {WAM-based} Prolog implementations. Our paper aims to show that declarative languages such as Prolog can indeed benefit from having a just-in-time compiler and that {PyPy} can form the basis for implementing programming languages other than Python.},

Our method provides cheap inter-procedural type specialization, and an elegant and efficient way of incrementally compiling lazily discovered alternative paths through nested loops.

Knowing which objects do not escape allows a compiler to perform aggressive {optimizations.This} paper presents a new intraprocedural and interprocedural algorithm for escape analysis in the context of dynamic compilation where the compiler has to cope with dynamic class loading and deoptimization. It was implemented for Sun Microsystems' Java {HotSpot™} client compiler and operates on an intermediate representation in {SSA} form. We introduce equi-escape sets for the efficient propagation of escape information between related objects. The analysis is used for scalar replacement of fields and synchronization removal, as well as for stack allocation of objects and fixed-sized arrays. The results of the interprocedural analysis support the compiler in inlining decisions and allow actual parameters to be allocated on the caller {stack.Under} certain circumstances, the Java {HotSpot™} {VM} is forced to stop executing a method's machine code and transfer control to the interpreter. This is called deoptimization. Since the interpreter does not know about the scalar replacement and synchronization removal performed by the compiler, the deoptimization framework was extended to reallocate and relock objects on demand.},

Many current systems follow the design of {HP} Dynamo and select a single interprocedural path, or trace, as the unit of code optimization and code caching. Though this approach to region selection has worked well in practice, we show that it is possible to adapt this basic approach to produce regions with greater locality, less needless code duplication, and fewer profiling counters. In particular, we propose two new region-selection algorithms and evaluate them against Dynamo¿s selection mechanism, Next-Executing Tail {(NET).} Our first algorithm, Last-Executed Iteration {(LEI)}, identifies cyclic paths of execution better than {NET}, improving locality of execution while reducing the size of the code cache. Our second algorithm allows overlapping traces of similar execution frequency to be combined into a single large region. This second technique can be applied to both {NET} and {LEI}, and we find that it significantly improves metrics of locality and memory overhead for each.},

The second extends the first by using additional high-level information such as field names. The third extends the second with a flow-insensitive analysis. Although other researchers suggests using types to disambiguate memory references, none evaluates its effectiveness. We perform both static and dynamic evaluations of type-based alias analyses for Modula-3, a statically-typed type-safe language. The static analysis reveals that type compatibility alone yields a very imprecise alias analysis, but the other two analyses significantly improve alias precision. We use redundant load elimination {(RLE)} to demonstrate the effectiveness of the three alias algorithms in terms of the opportunities for optimization, the impact on simulated execution times, and to compute an upper bound on what a perfect alias analysis would yield. We show modest dynamic improvements for {(RLE)}, and more surprisingly, that on average our alias analysis is within 2.5\% of a perfect alias analysis with respect to {RLE} on 8 Modula-3 programs. These results illustrate that to explore thoroughly the effectiveness of alias analyses, researchers need static, dynamic, and upper-bound analysis. In addition, we show that for type-safe languages like Modula-3 and Java, a fast and simple alias analysis may be sufficient for many applications.},

	abstract = {One trend among programmers is the increased use of abstractions. Through encapsulation techniques, abstractions extend the repertory of data structures and their concomitant operations that are processed directly by a compiler. For example, a compiler might not offer sets or set operations in its base language, but abstractions allow a programmer to define sets in terms of constructs already recognized by the compiler. In particular, abstractions can allow new constructs to be defined in terms of other abstractions. Although significant power is gained through the use of layered abstractions, object code quality suffers as increasingly less of a program's data structures and operations are exposed to the optimization phase of a compiler. Multiple references to abstractions are also inefficient, since the interaction between abstractions is often complex yet hidden from a compiler. Abstractions are most flexible when they are cast in general terms; a specific invocation is then tailored by the abstraction to obtain the appropriate code. A sequence of references to such abstractions can be inefficient due to functional redundancy that cannot be detected at compile-time. By integrating the references, the offending segments of code can be moved to a more advantageous position. Although procedure integration materializes abstracted constructs, the abstractions can still be ineligible for optimization using current techniques; in particular, abstractions often involve loops and conditional branches that can obscure code that would otherwise be eligible for code motion.},

Moreover, the new compositional structure opens the algorithm for modification: two further uni-directional analysis components exclude any unnecessary code motion.

	abstract = {We attempt to apply the technique of Tracing {JIT} Compilers in the context of the {PyPy} project, i.e., to programs that are interpreters for some dynamic languages, including Python. Tracing {JIT} compilers can greatly speed up programs that spend most of their time in loops in which they take similar code paths. However, applying an unmodified tracing {JIT} to a program that is itself a bytecode interpreter results in very limited or no speedup. In this paper we show how to guide tracing {JIT} compilers to greatly improve the speed of bytecode interpreters. One crucial point is to unroll the bytecode dispatch loop, based on two kinds of hints provided by the implementer of the bytecode interpreter. We evaluate our technique by applying it to two {PyPy} interpreters: one is a small example, and the other one is the full Python interpreter.},

Our system dynamically identifies traces of frequently executed bytecode instructions (which may span several basic blocks across several methods) and compiles them via Static Single Assignment {(SSA)} construction. Our novel use of {SSA} form in this context allows to hoist instructions across trace side-exits without necessitating expensive compensation code in off-trace paths. The overall memory consumption (code and data) of our system is only 150 {kBytes}, yet benchmarks show a speedup that in some cases rivals heavy-weight just-in-time compilers.},

	abstract = {Creating an interpreter is a simple and fast way to implement a dynamic programming language. With this ease also come major drawbacks. Interpreters are significantly slower than compiled machine code because they have a high dispatch overhead and cannot perform optimizations. To overcome these limitations, interpreters are commonly combined with just-in-time compilers to improve the overall performance. However, this means that a just-in-time compiler has to be implemented for each language.

We explore the approach of taking an interpreter of a dynamic 
language and running it on top of an optimizing trace-based virtual machine, i.e., we run a guest {VM} on top of a host {VM.} The host {VM} uses trace recording to observe the guest {VM} executing the application program. Each recorded trace represents a sequence
of guest {VM} bytecodes corresponding to a given execution path
through the application program. The host {VM} optimizes and compiles these traces to machine code, thus eliminating the need for a custom just-in-time compiler for the guest {VM.} The guest {VM} only needs to provide basic  information about its interpreter loop to the
host {VM.}},

	abstract = {We have developed and implemented techniques that double the performance of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages. Our {SELF} implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite {SELF's} lack of classes and explicit variables. To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. To compensate for dynamic typing, user-defined control structures, and the lack of explicit variables, our system dynamically compiles multiple versions of a source method, each customized according to its receiver's map. Within each version the type of the receiver is fixed, and thus the compiler can statically bind and inline all messages sent to self. Message splitting and type prediction extract and preserve even more static type information, allowing the compiler to inline many other messages. Inlining dramatically improves performance and eliminates the need to hard-wire low-level methods such as +,==, and {ifTrue:.} Despite inlining and other optimizations, our system still supports interactive programming environments. The system traverses internal dependency lists to invalidate all compiled methods affected by a programming change. The debugger reconstructs inlined stack frames from compiler-generated debugging information, making inlining invisible to the {SELF} programmer.},

	abstract = {A powerful application of specialization is to remove interpretative overhead: a language can be implemented with an interpreter, whose performance is then improved by specializing it for a given program source. This approach is only moderately successful with very high level languages, where the operation of each single step can be highly dependent on run-time data and context. In the present paper, the Psyco prototype for the Python language is presented. It introduces two novel techniques. The first is just-in-time specialization, or specialization by need, which introduces the "unlifting" ability for a value to be promoted from run-time to compile-time during specialization -- the inverse of the lift operator of partial evaluation. Its presence gives an unusual and powerful perspective on the specialization process. The second technique is representations, a theory of data-oriented specialization generalizing the traditional specialization domains (i.e. the compile-time/run-time dichotomy).},

	abstract = {For domain specific languages, "scripting languages", dynamic languages, and for virtual machine-based languages, the most straightforward implementation strategy is to write an interpreter. A simple interpreter consists of a loop that fetches the next bytecode, dispatches to the routine handling that bytecode, then loops. There are many ways to improve upon this simple mechanism, but as long as the execution of the program is driven by a representation of the program other than as a stream of native instructions, there will be some "interpretive {overhead".There} is a long history of approaches to removing interpretive overhead from programming language implementations. In practice, what often happens is that, once an interpreted language becomes popular, pressure builds to improve performance until eventually a project is undertaken to implement a native Just In Time {(JIT)} compiler for the language. Implementing a {JIT} is usually a large effort, affects a significant part of the existing language implementation, and adds a significant amount of code and complexity to the overall code {base.In} this paper, we present an innovative approach that dynamically removes much of the interpreted overhead from language implementations, with minimal instrumentation of the original interpreter. While it does not give the performance improvements of hand-crafted native compilers, our system provides an appealing point on the language implementation spectrum.},
