PyPy for mediocre programmers
=============================

This is a talk for mediocre Python programmers by a mediocre programmer.  PyPy
is an alternative implementation of Python. It is notorious for being fast, but
also for using clever algorithms pertaining to advanced concepts such as type
inference, garbage collection, just-in-time compilation, etc. So, can we,
mediocre programmers, realistically use PyPy?

Yes, absolutely. In fact, PyPy developers did all that hard work so that we
wouldn't have to. As we'll see, it runs most Python code exactly like CPython
does, save that it magically makes it faster.

Porting existing applications is always more involved than running a simple
script, so we'll also examine likely difficulties such as code relying on
CPython implementation details, and dependencies on C extensions, and explore
simple principles to let PyPy run your code even faster.

Finally, we'll have a glimpse of the future by looking at what's brewing in 
the PyPy lair, such as software transactional memory, new speed optimisations,
better support for Python 3 and NumPy, ...
