==================================
PyPy performance (not) for dummies
==================================


Abstract
---------

PyPy is the fastest Python interpreter around, and its JIT can optimize most
of your Python programs without problems. However, there are techniques to
improve the performances even further and squeeze the most out of PyPy. In
this talk we will see:

- the general principles behind the PyPy JIT

- how to profile programs to find the bottlenecks

- how to examine the code generated by the JIT

- how to write JIT-friendly programs
