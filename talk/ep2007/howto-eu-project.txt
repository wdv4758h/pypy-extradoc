How to do an EU open source research project 
==========================================================

We'll look at how to do an EU research proposal, based on
experiences obtained through the PyPy project.  We quickly
walk through the basics of the initial proposal, negotiations, 
the EU funding contract, cost/funding models and how we modified and
amended the contract afterwards.  The PyPy project has been one
of the first bigger open source research projects that
received funding from the EU - a liaison of diverging
cultures, as it turned out.  We had to learn how to manage
this project: track/report results, budget, 'resources' to match 
our contractual obligations, but also make the EU contract and
circumstances fit our needs and actual project developments.  
We'll highlight how the finalisation process with the EU 
(still pending for 31st May and following) worked out, summarize 
our findings and give some recommendations maybe helpful for 
other projects and organisations applying for EU Research funding.
