==================================================
How to do an open source EU research project
==================================================


:authors: Lene Wagner, Holger Krekel (merlinux GmbH) 
:event: 10.7.2007, EuroPython 2007, Vilnius 


Intro 
=================== 

- we have participated in the PyPy project 
- both on technical and management levels 
- founded merlinux GmbH in 2004, doing various projects 
- we discuss *open source* research projects 
- skip "Intellectucal Property" issues

EU Framework Research Programme 
====================================

- IST = Information Society and Technology 
- PyPy was a STREP 
- FP7 spends some 20.000.000.000 Euro in 7 years 
- regularly publishes Work Programmes and Topics 
- puts out CALLS for Proposals 
- we mainly discuss FP7 (only few changes from FP6) 

Getting started 
=====================

- visions / ideas? 
- reading Work programmes / CALL topics 
- finding people to collaborate 
- finding a set of organisations 
- drafting a proposal ... 

(Research) Objectives? 
==============================

- formulate core research objective(s)
  (state of the art & how the project aims beyond) 
- formulate core technical objectives? 
- core other objectives? (methodological/social) 

can you summarize it on one page? 

The Proposal 
===============

- High level Objectives 
- Impact on industry and society 
- management structures
- work plan in long form
- detailed description of work packages 
- Project duration, budget? 

Work Packages 
=================== 

- each has a specific objective 
- Person Months allocated from Partners 
- Lead Partner 
- Deliverables (Reports, Releases, Papers) 

Consortium 
============================

- looking for interested parties 
- consortium consists of organisations 
- is collective entity towards EU 
- requires co-ordinator/contact person for EU 
- receives and distributes money


Applying to the EU 
=========================

- answer to CALLS within stated deadline 
- co-ordinator registers project and proposal 
- proposals gets reviewed by *independent* experts 
- proposals receive points (PyPy had 26 out of 30) 
- Invitation to "negotiation" 

Negotiation 
==============

- discuss criticism of reviewers, change proposal 
- Prepare paperwork (CPF = Contract Preparation Forms) 
- sign CONTRACT with the European Union 

Funding Schemes
=====================

- Universities receive (basically) 75% funding 
- Small/Medium Companies (SME) receive 75% funding of costs 
- actual or 20% flat administrative overheads accountable

Signing the contract? 
========================

signature of the (negotiated) contract: 

- is legally binding for all contractors and the EU 
- afterwards the EU does pre-payments (40-80%) 
- the consortium can ask for amendments later 

Infrastructure 
==================
- ensure close collaboration of non co-located developers
- ensure openness for external contributors
- ensure consistency of codebase/project
- PyPy: IRC, svn, mailing lists


Management structures  
============================

- Administrative team (preparing Consortium decisions) 
- Technical Board (discussing problems, deciding roadmap) 
- developer body (everybody can participate) 
- Consortium and Co-ordinator


Meetings and Sprints 
============================

- sprints provide the rhythm of the project 
- plan for core for newcomer-friendly sprints 
- integrate a model for funding new contributors! 


Contractual and actual developments 
=====================================
- Contract implies a 'plan' for the development
- Project may evolve into other directions
- do checkpoints for assessing the work package status 

Planning for changes 
===========================

- be able to shift work among partners
- if necessary: amend work plan, change the contract with the EU
- but: don't touch the objectives!


Reporting / Deliverables 
============================

- interim reviews each 12-18 months 
- Deliverables are: Reports, Releases etc. 
- Deadlines 
- official submission of Reports/Documentation to EU

Recommendations 
====================

- sprint-driven model of development;
- share some funding with upcoming contributors;
- balance contractual with community interests 
- consider changes to the contractual work plan if 
  it fits the objectives better;

More Recommendations
========================
- transparent and flat communication and decision culture
- be ready to adjust roles and not stick to formal issues too much. 
- dual-use Deliverables for Community/Industry and EU contract purposes


Roles and Responsbilities 
============================

- assign responsibilities to people 

  - per aspect (administration, technical, research) 
  - per work package

- plan for changing responsibilities 

Changes from FP6 to FP7 
=============================

- apparently FP7 improves some regulations that PyPy found burdonsome
- less collective financial responsibility 
- 75% funding for (small/medium) companies 
- subcontracting relaxed (important for international companies)


What Remains? 
================================

- build the project on a shared vision and shared interest
- don't build it on money (too much) 
- get into contact with national support offices! 
- use the national and EU help infrastructure!
