I'm listing here some ideas gathered around on IRC:

1. "A usual pypy talk" - architecture, motivation etc. (samuele,armin)
2. An RPython talk: .NET, JVM, JS, extcompiler, possible uses, caveats,
   probably some architecture (anto,fijal)
3. Interpreters talk: taint, thunk, persistance, distribution, probably
   some stackless (?), interpreter for .NET (hpk, fijal)
4. recommendations on "how to" OSS/EU-funding/research project (hpk,lene)
5. development process "how to" (bea, hpk maybe)

These last two talks (4-5) should be scheduled together - let´s ask for it
when submitting. They are "final" recommendations and reflections from PyPy
regarding formal structures and informal structures (contract and development process).
(Phone discussion between hpk and bea 18/5)
