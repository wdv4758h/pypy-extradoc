RPython: need for speed
=======================

XXX: suggestions for title are welcome :-)
XXX: another proposition - C considered harmful

Speakers: Antonio Cuni & Maciek Fijalkowski

Abstract
--------

Restricted Python (RPython) is a subset of a Python language designed to be
compiled into lower-level languages, suitable for direct compilation
into C, CLI, JVM or others. RPython cuts some of python dynamism (allows for
full type inference and creation of flow graphs), but doesn't require explicit
type annotations.
Results might be up to 300 times faster than the
original python program. Although it was born as an implementation
detail of the PyPy interpreter, experience showed that it can be useful
by itself. This talk will present some typical RPython's use cases, including:
 * how to write a standalone executable in RPython.
 * how to write an extension module for CPython.
 * how to produce .NET libraries/executables as fast as C#
 * how to write AJAX applications without a single line of Javascript.
   (and with tests!)
 * how to create bub-n-bros client in just few lines of code running on
   a browser :-)
