PyPy: Why and how did it (not) work? 
-------------------------------------------------

Some people have said that they have hardly seen a large
project succeed with delivering to the original goals as much
as the PyPy project did.  Others consider it a failure because
it did not take over the world yet or is not usable for
mainstream purposes.  Anyway, we'll talk about the mix of
development processes, methods and infrastructure of the PyPy
project.  We will summarize our experiences regarding the
evolving development environment (version control, automated
test-driven development, sprints, synchronization, "conceptual
integrity", communication channels). We will also try to share
our "learning by burnings" so that other projects can explore
other creative problems and mistakes than maybe repeating the
ones we explored in depth already during the last 4 years of
PyPy development.
