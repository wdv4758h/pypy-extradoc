PyPy 1.0 and Beyond
--------------------

Speakers: Armin Rigo, Samuele Pedroni
 
Abstract
----------

PyPy released 1.0 in March of this year. PyPy contains a very
compliant Python interpreter, and with 1.0 the first
incarnation of a Just-In-Time compiler which is generated
from the interpreter automatically with novel techniques.  

In this talk we are going to give a brief introduction
to PyPy and its motivation. After recapitulating PyPy 
architecture we are going to give an overview of
how the JIT generation is achieved, through examples
and introducing the general ideas.

In the last part we are going to reflect on the current
status of PyPy's Python interpreter and our thoughts
about its future and further progress on the JIT compiler.
