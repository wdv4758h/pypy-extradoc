Requested Timeslot
------------------

45 minutes or 30 minutes. both possible (the talk can be considered
a kind of tutorial on PyPy architectural pictures). 

Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

After reaching important milestones, the PyPy project is now
(starting autumn 2005) heading towards building a specializing
JIT-compiler, stackless features and translation to higher
level languages into the code base.   In this session we will
present and interactively discuss with the audience the basic
architectural pictures.  We'd are going to emphasize the
various emerging possibilities for further development part of
which will be an ongoing effort of the European Union's funded
part of the PyPy project. 

In particular, we'll describe the following architectural pictures 
and point out extension and optimization possibilities: 

- Language Implementation: Bytecode Interpreter and Object Space interaction
- Translation to low level languages (C/LLVM)
- Translation to higher level languages (e.g. Squeak/Java) 
- JIT-compiler architecture (very-low-level/l3 interpreter) 
- Interweaving of Garbage Collection, threading and stackless
  operations into the translation process 

Intended audience
-----------------

People who feel comfortable with receiving too much information 
and accept that there are more levels of architecture involved 
than a single person can instantly cope with.
