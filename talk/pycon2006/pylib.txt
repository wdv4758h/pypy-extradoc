Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

Title: using the py library (apart from py.test) 

The py lib is a development support library and evolves itself
from a strictly test-driven development process.  Already
known for the widely used py.test tool, the "py lib" has more
to offer.  

Apart from its intense usage in the PyPy project a number of
other projects have adapted its methods.  We plan to give
usage examples for various parts of the py library: 

- py.log:     keyword/subscription based lazy logging 
- py.compat:  provides standard library modules for older python versions
- py.initpkg: export name/lazy import mechanism ("import py" 
              is all you ever need to do).
- py.path:    path objects unifying access to svn- and
              local filesystems. 
- py.execnet: ad-hoc distributing programs across ssh- and process
              barriers. 

All of these features are already used by a growing number of 
projects.  We will give interactive examples and conclude 
with an outlook.
