Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

There is a growing number of open-source developers
organized and connected to company and money related work.
We report our experiences from the first year of the PyPy
project which has a 7 company/university consortium and a
1.3 Million Euro research grant from the European Union.

We'd like to present and discuss models and experiences
for connecting open-source/hacking culture driven development 
to money related projects and goals with the audience.  

We are going to briefly describe the organisation of the PyPy project, 
showing how formal stakeholders and OSS Python community interact 
through agile practices like sprinting.  We will also reflect on the 
aspect of diversity, combining technical and non technical people and 
skills and learnings from this.

We will relate the various agile techniques used in PyPy
and other projects/companies to the agile practices known from 
the work in the Agile Alliance (XP, Scrum, Crystal) in order to show how 
agile techniques have been adopted and evolved by the Python community. 

Lastly we will also share our experience of various challenges and 
possibilities when integrating the different cultures and skills from 
the OSS perspective, EU perspective and the Chaos Pilot/process management 
perspective - managing diversities.
