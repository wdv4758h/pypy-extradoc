What can PyPy do for you?

Peek under the hood
====================
 
 * ``sys.pypy_repr(obj)``

 * returns the interpreter-level representation of an object

 * ... demo

Stackless Features (1/2)
========================

 * PyPy can be translated with stackless features

 * allows arbitrarily deep recursion

 * enables usage of coroutines

 * tasklets and channels (as in Stackless Python)

 * greenlets without evil platform hacks


Stackless Features (2/2)
========================

 * experimentally: (un-)pickling of coroutines

 * working on: making coroutines clonable

 * made possible by our mark-n-sweep GC

 * ... demo


Lazy Computations
=================

   <br>

two object spaces with lazy features:
-------------------------------------

 * thunk object space: lazily computed objects

 * logic object space: logic variables, unification, microthreads


The Thunk Object Space
======================

 * ``thunk(f, *args, **kwargs)``

 * returns something that behaves like the result of the call

 * the call is made as late as possible, only when the value is actually needed

 * ... demo

The Logic Object Space
======================

 * variables can be used to synchronize microthreads

 * quite safe because variables can be bound once only

 * general unification, pattern matching (prolog-like, Oz-like)

 * in progress: constraint programming


The Extension-Compiler
======================

 * pypy extension modules are written in RPython

 * extensions translated to efficient low level code
 
 * write fast extensions for PyPy `and` CPython

RCTypes
=======

 * Makes it possible to use RCTypes in RPython

 * usual type restrictions apply

 * dynamic libary calls are translated to real ones

 * makes wrapping of libaries easy and testable

 * again useable with PyPy and CPython
 

The Javascript backend
======================

Creates Javascript programs with Python semantics
 

Why would you want that?
========================

 * ...


Why would you want that?
========================

 * Because Python is way more fun than Javascript

 * ...


Why would you want that?
========================

 * Because Python is way more fun than Javascript

 * Because it will allow you to test your code on top of a Python interpreter

 * ...


Why would you want that?
========================

 * Because Python is way more fun than Javascript

 * Because it will allow you to test your code on top of a Python interpreter

 * "Mochikit makes JavaScript suck less"

 * PyPy makes living with JavaScript fun


Why would you want that?
========================

 * Because Python is way more fun than Javascript

 * Because it will allow you to test your code on top of a Python interpreter

 * "Mochikit makes JavaScript suck less"
 
 * PyPy makes living with JavaScript fun
   (by not using it)


Who?
====

 * It relies heavily on PyPy translation tool-chain

 * Started about 9 months ago

 * Restarted as a high-level backend by Maciej Fijalkowski for Google SoC 2006


Current features
================

 * Using native Javascript for things like inheritance

 * Semi transparent server-side call

 * Limited support for DOM/CSS and whatnot


What to do next
===============

 * Make the webcode testable on Python interpreters
 
 * Finish DOM interface
 
 * Coroutines/stackless features


Examples
========

 * simple AJAX example

 * check pypy svn for a Console sample
