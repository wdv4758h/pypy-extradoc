Implementing Python in Python 
==============================

A report from the PyPy project
******************************
The PyPy_ [#]_ project aims at producing a simple runtime-system for
the Python_ language, written in Python itself.  **C** and **Lisp**
are elder examples of languages which are self-hosting.  More
recently, we have seen implementations of **Scheme** in Scheme_, [#]_
and **Squeak**, [#]_ [#]_ a Smalltalk_ implementation of Smalltalk_.
The desire to implement your favourite language *in* your
favourite language is quite understandable.  Every significant
computer language has a certain expressiveness and power, and it is
frustrating to not be able to use that expressiveness and power when
writing the language itself.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _Scheme: http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/
.. _Squeak: http://www.squeak.org
.. _Smalltalk: http://www.smalltalk.org/

Thus we aim to produce a minimal core which is *simple* and
*flexible*, and no longer dependent on CPython [#]_.  This should make
PyPy_ easier than CPython to analyze, change and debug. We will take
care that PyPy will integrate easily with Psyco_ [#]_ and Stackless_, [#]_ 
while trying to avoid unwitting C dependencies in our thinking.

.. _Psyco: http://psyco.sourceforge.net/
.. _Stackless: http://www.stackless.com/

We should be able to produce different versions of PyPy which run
on different architectures,  for instance one that runs on the 
Java Virtual Machine, much as Jython_ [#]_ does today.  

.. _Jython: http://www.jython.org/

By keeping things *simple* and *flexible* we can produce code that has
attractions for both industry and academia.  Academics will find that
this Python is even easier to teach concepts of language design with.
Industry will be pleased to know that ending the dependence on CPython
means that we can produce a Python with a smaller footprint.
Eventually, we would like to produce a faster Python , which should
please all.  We are very far from that now, because speed is a distant
goal.  So far we have only worked on making PyPy *simple* and
*flexible*.

Most of you know what happens if you type::
     
     import this

at your favourite Python prompt.  You get *The Zen of Python*, [#]_
written by Tim Peters.  It starts::

     Beautiful is better than ugly.
     Explicit is better than implicit.

and ends with::

     Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

This raises an interesting question.  What would *doing more of those*  
mean?  The PyPy project takes one approach.


Terminology (a short digression)
********************************

In PyPy there is a distinction between **application level code**, which
is the world that PyPy is interpreting, and which can use the full features 
of the language, and the **interpreter level code** which is the world
that CPython is interpreting.  The interpreter level code
needs to be written in a restricted subset of Python.
(Currently you are mainly restricted to immutable objects; no dicts, you can
use globals but you cannot modify them.  *What defines Restricted Python?*
is a matter of current debate.)

In a Python-like language, a running interpreter has three main parts:
  
  * the main loop, which shuffles data around and calls the operations defined in the object library according to the bytecode.
  * the compiler, which represents the static optimization of the source code into an intermediate format, the bytecode;  and
  * the object library, implementing the various types of objects and their semantics;

In PyPy, the three parts are clearly separated and can be replaced
independently.  The main loop generally assumes little about the semantics
of the objects: they are essentially black boxes (PyObject pointers). The
interpreter stack and the variables only contain such black boxes.
Every operation is done via calls to the object library, such as
PyNumber_Add().  We haven't done much to make the compiler and the main
loop into explicit concepts (yet),  because we have been concentrating
on making separable object libraries.

We call the separable object library, an *Object Space*.
We call the black boxes of an Object Space *Wrapped Objects*.

One exciting thing is that while existing languages implement _one_
Object Space, by separating things we have produced an architecture
which will enable us to run more than one Object Space in the same
interpreter at the same time.  This idea has some interesting implications.

But first let us dream for a bit.  (Aside from having fun, why should
we spend our time writing PyPy?)

Goals:
++++++
or Dreams, if you prefer


A Slimmer Python
++++++++++++++++
People who write code for handhelds and other embedded devices often
wish that they could have a much smaller footprint.  With PyPy it
would be possible to load a Tiny Object Space which only implements
the behaviour which they need, and skips the parts that they do not.

A Native Reference Language
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Currently, we have two widely-used implementations of Python, CPython,
and Jython.  Whenever they differ, the question always comes up: Is
Jython *wrong*?  By this, people mean, is this behaviour which exists
in CPython, a matter of the language definition, which Jython ought to
support, or is it instead an irrelevant detail, the historical
accident of how things happened to be implemented in CPython, which
Jython is free to ignore?  It would be useful to have an independent
Reference Language, written in Python itself to stand as the model of
what is compliant Python.  A PyPy Object Space will provide this.
Moreover, people who would like to experiment with a proposed Python
language change will have an easier task.  Proposed new language
features, could profit from first being written in PyPy so that more
people could use, comment, and modify them before final approval or
rejection.

Getting better use of machines with multiple CPUs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(Also known as *Killing the Global Interpreter Lock*).  We believe
that we have barely scratched the surface of what can be done with
the new hardware architectures we have created.  The old idea of
*one machine, one CPU* persists, so it is difficult to partition the
work in such a way to keep all the CPUs occupied.  We hope to be able
to design our interpreter so that each CPU could be busy with its own
Object Space.

Running different Object Spaces on different machines
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Well, why not?  Whenever the time needed to do the calculating exceeds
the time needed to communicate between the various calculators, you
will benefit by adding more CPUS.  Thus PyPy will provide you with an
alternative way to write a Cluster.  (`The Beowulf Cluster`_ is
probably the most famous of Cluster architectures).  Right now 'network
computing' is in its infancy.  We don't know how to take advantage of
the resources we have.  Ideally, one could begin a computation on a
small device, say a mobile phone, and have the interpreter notice that
the device is underpowered for such a computation and transparently
forward the computation to a machine with more computational power.
You could have *peak computing machines* in the same way that
electrical utilities have plants which are expensive to
run and only come on-line when demand is extremely high.  As computers
become ubiquitous, we will *need* such demand based load sharing.

.. _The Beowulf Cluster: http://www.beowulf-underground.org/index.html

Multiple, Dynamically Changing Implementations of a Single Type
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Consider the question: *What is the best way to implement a dict*?

How one answers depends on how much data one intends to store.
If the dict is never expected to have more than a half dozen items, a
really fast list may be best.  Larger dicts might best be implemented
as hashes.  For storing enormous amounts of data, a binary tree
might be just what you desire.  In principle, there is
nothing to stop your interpreter from keeping statistics on how it is
being used, and to move from strategy to strategy at runtime.  You
could implement this in CPython, but we intend to make it a lot
*easier* to do this in PyPy to encourage such experimentation.

A better teaching vehicle
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Python has proven to be an excellent first programming language.
However, once the student develops a desire to see the nuts and bolts
of how one implements a language, when they look under the hood, they
find C, sometimes the sort of C one writes when speed optimisation is
of paramont importance.  For pedagological purposes, one would prefer
a language implementation whose chief virtue is *clarity* so that the
concepts are illustrated cleanly.

However, academic computer science is littered with tiny teaching
languages.  Every time we get a few new ideas in language design or
pedagogical theory we itch to create a language to express these
ideas.  While understandable, this is wasteful.  Many languages are
implemented which are more novel than useful, and too many are begun
with insufficient new ideas.  At one extreme, we end up force-feeding
our poor students with too many computer languages, too quickly --
each language designed to teach a particular point.  Alas, many of our
languages are particularly weak on everything *except* the point we
wish to make.

At the other extreme, many students go to university and end up only
learning how to program in commercially successful languages.  This
reduces university to a Giant Trade School, where it is possible to
avoid learning Computer Science altogether.  What we need is a the
middle way, a Pythonic way between purity and practicality, theory and
practice.

PyPy may be able to help.  The separation should make learning concepts
easier, and the ability to create one's own Object Spaces provides a
useful way to compare and contrast different techniques.  Finally, we
could reasonably ask our students to **implement** interesting
theories in Python, producing slightly different Object Spaces which
could leave the bulk of the language implementation unchanged.

There is no better way to learn about compiler writing, than writing
compilers, but much of today's education in compiler writing leaves a
huge gap between 'the theory that is in the book which the student is
expected to learn' and 'what is reasonable for a student to implement
as coursework'.  Students can spend all semester overcoming
difficulties in *actually getting the IO to work*, and *interfacing
with the runtime libraries*, while only spending a fraction of the
time on the concepts which you are trying to teach.

Object Spaces could provide a better fit between the the abstract
concepts we wish to teach and the code written to implement just that.

Runtime Adaptation of C-Libraries and System-Calls
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Python is already widely used for integrating and driving C-libraries
(for numerical computation, 3D-modeling etc.).  We dream
of introducing runtime mechanisms that allow PyPy to directly setup and
execute "native" calls on a machine.  For this to work we need
"trampolin" (assembler-) functions that build a C-like stackframe
and trigger a call directly into e.g. the linux kernel or 
any C-library without having to use a C-compiler.  This technique
would clearly be of great value to embedded devices but also
to regular python applications that could more easily use C-libraries
once they obtain a pythonic description of the library (possibly
generated from ``.h`` files).

A Smarter, more Dynamic Interpreter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
A Virtual Machine written in Python, should be easier to maintain and
optimise. By recording statistics and analysing the bytecodes that are
running through the machine, it is possible to find a shorter, and
faster way to run a script - the essence of optimisation. Native code
compilers do it all the time, but obviously only once at compilation
time. Interpreters can optimise in exactly same way, but at *run
time*. `The Hotspot Java Virtual Machine`_ already does this.

.. _The Hotspot Java Virtual Machine: http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/docs/whitepaper/Java_Hotspot_v1.4.1/Java_HSpot_WP_v1.4.1_1002_1.html

Faster Python
+++++++++++++
(Okay, you've caught us ...)
While we are writing an adaptive, smarter compiler, we ought to be able
to make it faster.  We think we can produce a Just-In-Time compiler which
is faster than C Python without destroying the clarity in our architecture.
Indeed, the ability to run different object spaces at the same time, in the
same interpreter will be most useful in this application.  Psyco already
uses similar techniques to great effect.

Speaking of Running different Object Spaces at the Same Time
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This dream is a bit far-fetched, but it is worth investigating.  Code
migration currently involves going through one's entire codebase
looking for conflicts.  This makes converting to newer versions of the
language both expensive and difficult.  There is a trade-off between
getting the new features which contribute to increased productivity in
program design, and having to fix piles of old code that wasn't broken
until the language changed.  With multiple Object Spaces approach it
may be possible to have your cake and eat it too.

You could load your existing modules with the Object Space they were
developed for while immediately using new features in new code that
you develop.  It would be up to the PyPy interpreter to see that these
Object Spaces communicate with each other transparently.  Only modules
that would particularly benefit from having the new features, would
be modified.  The rest could sleep peacefully, unchanged.

This leads to:

World Domination
++++++++++++++++
And if we don't pull this off, we will have at least learned a lot. This
in itself makes the project worth doing.  Plus it's fun...

But away from the dreams and back to what do we currently have?

We now have a pretty good working interpreter which implements
advanced language features such as nested scopes, generators and
metaclasses.  Most **types** and **builtins** are either completely
implemented or nearly there.  We have extensive unit tests, since we
believe in test driven design, even though we don't always practice
it.  

We currently have three object spaces at least partially implemented.


The Trivial Object Space
++++++++++++++++++++++++
A PyPy interpreter using the Trivial Object Space is an
interpreter with its own main loop (written in Python), and nothing
else.  This main loop manipulates real Python objects and all
operations are done directly on the Python objects. For example, "1"
really means "1" and when the interpreter encounters the BINARY_ADD
bytecode instructions the Trivial Object Space will just add two real
Python objects together using Python's "+". The same for lists,
dictionaries, classes ... we just use Python's own.  Delegate Object
Space might have been a better name for this Object Space.

This Object Space is only useful for testing the concept of Object Spaces,
and our interpreter, or even interpreting different kinds of bytecodes.
This is already implemented; it is funny to watch *dis.dis* disassembling 
itself painfully slowly.

Getting this to work was a goal of the Hildesheim Sprint February 16-23.
It demonstrated that our Object Space Concept was viable, and that our
interpreter worked.

The Standard Object Space
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Standard Object Space is the object space that works just like
Python's, that is, the object space whose black boxes are real Python
objects that work as expected. Getting the Standard Object Space to
work was a goal of the Gothenburg Sprint May 24 - 31.

The Standard Object Space defines an abstract parent class, W_Object,
and a bunch of subclasses like W_IntObject, W_ListObject, and so on. A
wrapped object (a *black box* for the interpreter main loop) is thus
an instance of one of these classes. When the main loop invokes an
operation, say the addition, between two wrapped objects w1 and w2,
the StandardObjectSpace does some internal dispatching (similar to
"Object/ abstract.c" in CPython) and invokes a method of the proper
W_XyzObject class that can do the operation. The operation itself is
done with the primitives allowed by Restricted Python. The result is
constructed as a wrapped object again.

The following was our first trivial program::

 ### our first trivial program ###
 
 aStr = 'hello world'
 print len(aStr)

to run.  We needed types and builtins to work.  This ran, slowly.

We began testing and adding types and builtins.

Getting this code to work was the second goal.::

 ### a trivial program to test strings, lists, functions and methods ###
 
 def addstr(s1,s2):
     return s1 + s2

 str = "an interesting string"
 str2 = 'another::string::xxx::y:aa'
 str3 = addstr(str,str2)
 arr = []
 for word in str.split():
     if word in str2.split('::'):
        arr.append(word)
 print ''.join(arr)
 print "str + str2 = ", str3

This we accomplished by mid-week.

By the end of the Sprint we produced our first Python program [#]_ that
ran under PyPy which simply 'did something we wanted to do' and wasn't
an artificial goal.  It calculated the week long foodbill, and divided
the result by the 9 Sprint participants.::

 ### the first real PyPy Program ###

Pypy said: 603 SEK, or approximately 75 USD.   Don't believe people who
tell you that Sprints are too expensive to hold. 

The Annotation Object Space
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Our third Sprint was held at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium (near
Brussels), June 21 - 24.  Great progress was made with the The
Annotation Object Space, and began abstract, symbolic interpretation.
(We also spent a lot of time firming up the Standard Object Space, and
improving our documentation, and our documentation tools).

In the two object spaces so far, application-level objects are
represented in the interpreter as objects that represent a value.
This is so obvious as to not need pointing out, except for the fact
that the Annotation space does something completely different.

Here the interpreter-level object corresponding to a application-level
variable does not describe the value of the variable, but rather the
state of knowledge about the contents of the variable.
For example, after the code::

 x = 1
 y = 2
 z = x + y

we know exactly what *x*, *y* and *z* contain: the integers *1*, *2* and *3*
respectively, and this is how the annotation object space represents
them: there is a class W_Constant that represents totally known values.

However in::

  def f(x, y):
      z = x + y
      
  f(1, 2)
  f(2, 3)

we know less.  We know that x and y only contain integers, but their
values are no longer entirely fixed.  In this case, the annotation
object space could chose to represent the variable in the body of f
as *either* the constant *1* or the constant *2*, but at present it punts
and simply represents it as an instance of W_Integer.

The eventual hope is to run all of the code that implements PyPy's
interpreter and the standard object space with the annotation object
space and gain sufficient knowledge of the values involved to generate
efficient code (in C, Pyrex_, O'Caml, Java or whatever) to do the same
job.

If you're wondering how we expect to get a speed up of 20000 times by
this translation when a speed up of 100 or so times is all that
usually obtained by rewriting in C, you have to understand that the
main reason for the standard object space's current slowness is the
computation of which code to execute each time a multimethod is
called.  The knowledge gathered by the Annontation Object Space should
be sufficient to remove or at least substantially reduce this computation 
for most of the call sites.

Current plans are to use the information gathered from the Annotation Object 
Space to emit Pyrex_ code which itself will generate a CPython extension.

.. _Pyrex: http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/

Types
+++++
Types are implemented by the class W_TypeObject. This is where
inheritance and the Method Resolution Order are defined, and where
attribute look-ups are done.

Instances of user-defined types are implemented as W_UserObjects. A
user-defined type can inherit from built-in types (maybe more than
one, although this is incompatible with CPython). The W_UserObject
delegator converts the object into any of these "parent objects" if
needed. This is how user-defined types appear to inherit all built-in
operator implementations.

Delegators should be able to invoke user code; this would let us
implement special methods like __int__() by calling them within a
W_UserObject -> int delegator.

Multimethods
++++++++++++
Interpreter-level classes correspond to implementations of
application-level types.  The hierarchy among the classes used for the
implementations is convenient for implementation purposes. It is not
related to any application-level type hierarchy.  Multimethods
dispatch by looking in a set of registered functions. Each registered
function has a signature, which defines which object implementation
classes are accepted at the corresponding argument position.

Specifics of multimethods
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Multimethods dispatch more-specific-first, left-to-right (i.e. if
there is an exact match for the first argument it will always be tried
first).

Delegators are automatically chained (i.e. A -> B and B -> C would be
combined to allow for A -> C delegation).

Delegators do not publish the class of the converted object in
advance, so that the W_UserObject delegator can potentially produce
any other built-in implementation. This means chaining and chain loop
detection cannot be done statically (at least without help from an
analysis tool like the translator-to-C). To break loops, we can assume
(unless a particular need arises) that delegators are looping when
they return an object of an already-seen class.

Registration
++++++++++++
The register() method of multimethods adds a function to its database
of functions, with the given signature. A function that raises
FailedToImplement causes the next match to be tried.

'delegate' is the special unary multimethod that should try to convert
its argument to something else. For greater control, it can also
return a list of 2-tuples (class, object), or an empty list for
failure to convert the argument to anything. All delegators will
potentially be tried, and recursively on each other's results to do
chaining.

Multimethod slicing
+++++++++++++++++++
Multimethods are visible to user code as (bound or unbound) methods
defined for the corresponding types. (At some point built-in functions
like *len()* and the *operator.xxx()* should really directly map to the
multimethods themselves, too.)

To build a method from a multimethod (e.g. as in *l.append* or
*int.__add__*), the result is actually a "slice" of the whole
multimethod, i.e. a sub-multimethod in which the registration table
has been trimmed down. (Delegation mechanisms are not restricted for
sliced multimethods.)

Say that C is the class the new method is attached to (in the above
examples, respectively, C=type(l) and C=int). The restriction is based
on the registered class of the first argument ('self' for the new
method) in the signature. If this class corresponds to a fixed type
(as advertized by 'statictype'), and this fixed type is C or a
superclass of C, then we keep it.

Some multimethods can also be sliced along their second argument,
e.g. for __radd__().

A Word of History
+++++++++++++++++

The PyPy project was started in January of 2003 by Armin Rigo,
Christian Tismer and Holger Krekel. The latter organized the initial
Coding-Sprint in Hildesheim, Germany where the interpreter and the
Trivial Object Space were implemented and people first got together.
The second sprint in Göteborg, Sweden was organized by Jacob Hallén and
Laura Creighton and it resulted in much of today's Standard Object Space
implementation.  Benjamin Henrion and Godefroid Chapelle organized the
third sprint in Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium which led to a pretty complete
Standard ObjectSpace and interpreter and the beginnings of Abstract
Interpretation (Annotation Object Space).  These three coding
sprints in the course of half a year brought PyPy to existence, though
there was some off-sprint development and discussions going on.

Conclusions
+++++++++++
It is a little early for conclusions, but our architecture seems to be
working so far.  Sprints are a lot of fun, and a great way to write
code, and meet interesting people.  We're productively lazy, and so
have created a few tools that could possibly be useful to other
projects ... parts of our test rig, for example, and automatic ReST
processing on checkins.  An Infastructure mini-Sprint, again at
Hildesheim, is planned which may produce tools good enough to package
and release separately.
