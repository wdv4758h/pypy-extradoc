PyPy status talk
================

In this talk I would like to give an update on the status of
the PyPy project. Most of the talk will focus on PyPy's JIT,
a new feature that allows to run (some, so far) programs really
fast. I'll also present in detail how to exploit the JIT's
possiblities and future directions.

Bio:

I'm a core developer of the PyPy project, involved in it for the
last couple of years. In recent years I spent a lot of time improving
the dynamic compilation features of PyPy as well as improving the
general PyPy compatibility.
