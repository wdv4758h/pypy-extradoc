Title: PyPy, the implementation of Python in Python

Abstract: We'd like to present the PyPy project, which is both:

- A very very flexible compiler toolchain, which translates a restricted subset
of Python to a variety of languages (C, LLVM, CLI, JVM, JavaScript...)

- An implementation of a Python interpreter, with many novel features, including
Psyco-style specializing JIT, stackless-like coroutines and many others.

The PyPy project has been funded for the last two years by the EU

The PyPy is open source project, for more details about it see http://codespeak.net/pypy
