* discuss removal GIL ruby paper
* measure things
** memory: residual & GC-numbers
** overhead: breakdown (maybe also with multiple threads)
** scaling: microbenchmark
** real-world: our benchmarks on all working interpreters (& Jython)
* explain better the GC-STM integration and its benefits

Finalize
========

* check "claims" in discussion.txt
* re-check the benchmark results (any unexplained weirdness?)
* find references / citations / related work
* check abstract and conclusion, acks & authors
