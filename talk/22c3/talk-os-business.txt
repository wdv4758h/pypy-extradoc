Title:  agile open-source methods <-> business/EU-funding 

Subtitle: Sprint driven development in Open Source projects - 
          agile methods in open-source related companies 

Section: Hacker(ethik), (or Culture? or Community?)

Talkers: Beatrice Düring, Holger Krekel 

Abstract (max 250 letters): 

    There is a growing number of open-source developers
    organized and connected to company and money related work.
    We report our experiences from the first year of the PyPy
    project which has a 7 company/university consortium and a
    1.3 Million Euro research grant from the European Union.

Description (250-500 words): 

    We'd like to present and discuss models and experiences
    for connecting open-source/hacking culture driven development 
    to money related projects and goals with the audience.  

    We are going to briefly describe the organisation of the PyPy project, 
    showing how formal stakeholders and OSS Python community interact 
    through agile practices like sprinting.  We will also reflect on the 
    aspect of diversity, combining technical and non technical people and 
    skills and learnings from this.

    We will relate the various agile techniques used in PyPy
    and other projects/companies to the agile practices known from 
    the work in the Agile Alliance (XP, Scrum, Crystal) and tell
    you what we know of how other projects are doing it.  

    Lastly we will also share our experience of various challenges and 
    possibilities when integrating the different cultures and skills from 
    the OSS perspective, EU perspective and the Chaos Pilot/process management 
    perspective - managing diversities.
