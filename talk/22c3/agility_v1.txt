This paper walks through different aspects of agility 
within the open-source PyPy project [#]_.  Agility has played a key role 
from the beginning. The PyPy project started from some mails
between a few people, quickly had a first one-week meeting, a "sprint",
from where it evolved into a structure that was able to carry
out a research project - and got accepted by the European
Union.  During the course, two companies were founded. They are
now growing and employing key developers. 

PyPy's technical development is strongly rooted in open-source
contexts and this adds another agility aspect - free
communication, co-operation and exchange with other people and
projects.  

The process of obtaining EU-funding is a continous challenge to 
the community-rooted PyPy project; how to connect
agile open source culture with formal structures, interaction
with requirements like planning, budget estimation, work
distribution and resource tracking.  

After our first "funded" year we are reasonably happy with the
balance we strike between organisations and EU funding on the
one and the developers driving the technical aspects of the
project on the other side.

Agility in Technical Development and Organisation 
=========================================================

Agile approaches: sprinting
----------------------------

PyPy first started during a one-week meeting, a "sprint", held at Trillke-Gut
in Hildesheim February 2003. The sprint was inspired by practices used by other
Python projects such as Zope3.  Originally the sprint methodology used in the
Python community grew from practices applied by the Zope Corporation.  Their
definition of a sprint was:  "two-day or three-day focused development session,
in which developers pair off together in a room and focus on building a
particular subsystem". 

Sprinting up to a week became the initial driving factor in developing 
the code base and the community/people around it.  The early PyPy sprints 
were organised by core developers together with local Pythonistas 
in Louvain La Neuve, Gothenburg, Vilnius and Amsterdam.  Sprints gave
the opportunity to both help, participate and influence the ideas within PyPy.

Sprints are actually not part of the traditional Agile
portfolio of techniques, the closest thing to it comes from
Scrum [#]_ who names the 30 days long programming iterations
"sprints", covering a certain increment.  With the Scrum method, 
considerable effort is put into performing the sprint planning
as well as creating and documenting the "sprint backlog" which
is then feedbacked into the "Product backlog".  The sprint ends
with a "sprint review" - an informal planning session in which
the team decides on upcoming work.  There are also techniques
in which the team looks at ways to improve the development
methodology and future sprints.

To our knowledge, open-source projects these days are sprinting for at most
a week which reflects the fact that many contributors give their time 
and even money to gather and work together.  This is different 
from having fully funded people from one company working together. 

Why did PyPy choose sprinting as a key technique?  It is a method that fits
distributed teams well because it gets the team focused around visible 
challenging goals while working collarobatively (pair-programming, status
meetings, discussions etc) as well as acceleratedly (short increments and
tasks, "doing" and testing instead of long startups of planning and
requirement gathering).   This means that most of the time a sprint is a great
way of getting results and getting new people aquainted - a good 
method for dissemination of knowledge and learning within the team. 

A key insight, worthwhile for other EU-projects to ponder, is how an agile
process like sprinting is much more suited for creative work between groups of
distributed people. Traditional software development, as well as traditional
project management techniques have a tendency to hinder creativity due to the
inbuilt over-structured, segmented and control-oriented approach which in most
cases ends in less quality when results are being measured.

Agile approaches: test-driven development
-----------------------------------------

Test-driven development is a technical cornerstone for programming
efficiently together in a distributed team.  Seen from the
Agile Manifesto perspective it is right up there as one of the
key elements since it puts focus on producing working code,
rather than diagrams, plans and papers (and then faulty
software).

Seen from an Open Source community perspective it is a vitalising strategy -
especially in combination with a transparent open process in which anyone
interested can participate - if only for just a few days at a sprint.  One of
the key problems identified by Frederick P. Brooks in the latest version of
"The Mythical Man-Month" [#]_ (unfortunately still very actual today) is estimating
correct amount of time for communication and testing/debugging.  Automated
testing, rather barrier-free communication and strict version tracking helps 
with that problem, especially in the hands of a team sprinting its way through 
the Python community - welcoming everyone to participate.

Apart from rewriting a practical programming language within
itself, PyPy also evolved a number of development tools useful
for writing tests and glueing things together. PyPy's testing
tool ("py.test") is used separately and evolves on its own by now.

Agility: Open Communication and organisation
----------------------------------------------------

Another agility aspect relates to transparent and open
communication within the project.  Only very few (EU-contract
related) documents are access restricted, everything else is
freely available.  There are no hierarchies for commit rights.
In fact, the server also hosts a couple of
other projects and all projects share commit rights ("Coding
Wiki").  Announcing Sprints, Releases and development goals
lead to an increasing amount of people subscribing to mailing lists or
participating in development. 

Moreover, the PyPy developers implemented a method with weekly 30-minute 
IRC chat meetings where topics were briefly discussed, delegated
or decided upon. Those meetings are open to all active developers 
and usually do not touch upon internal EU matters much except that 
funded developers keep EU goals more in mind than others. 
Minutes of these weekly developer meetings get archived and posted 
to the development list. 

A rather recent invention is the postings of "This week in PyPy".
The text is a summary of what is going on in the lively IRC 
development #pypy channel - main place of technical coordination.

How and why EU funding? 
=====================================================================

Mid 2003 the idea of trying to get EU-funding for the project was born. 
It became clear that the project had an arbitrarily large scale and that
receiving some funding would dramatically increase the pace and seriousness
of the project - because funded developers can dedicate more of their time
to the project.  The involved developers and people stretched outside of the 
Open Source ecologies to try to gather as much information and contacts as 
possible in order to answer the question: "Should we go for it?"  to which 
the answer quickly became "Let's see how far we get!". 

Making things fit with EU perspectives 
------------------------------------------------------

There had been a growing interest from the European Commission, IST division,
to look closer at the Open Source world and its achievements. Several funded
research projects in the 5th framework programme studied the phenomen
(FLOSS-POLS, FLOSS) - its organization, business models and licensings. A few
other funded software projects used Open Source in their work as tools
(languages and applications).  There was no previous experience of an Open
Source community based project making a bid for funding. 

The areas in the 6th Framework programme (second call) fit very well with the
objectives of PyPy.  The idea of strengthening the European Software
development companies and businesses with supporting an open source language
implementation was new but appealing to the EU.  However, being an Open Source
project wasn´t enough. The challenges and the idea of a flexible, configurable
"translator" or "compiler" met the research targets of the FP6, as well as
trying out and documenting the agile methodology being used.  It is interesting
to note that most of today's computer language research and development happens
in the US.

In short, we argued that EU funding allowed the project to go from
reaching a critical mass and position to continue to evolve from 
there, and that it would help European Organisations to make some
ground. 

Acting on this strategy proved to be a more difficult task. The entire proposal
and negotiation process took over a year (Autumn 2003 until November 2004).A
proper description of planned work, necessary to satisfy formal requirements,
had not previously been part of the development focus and both the EU and the
parties involved had to adapt to the situation.  Yet, drafting the high-level
requirements (in total 14 workpackages and 58 deliverables) was done using the
same version-control/open-communication based work style, including evolving
the proposal at sprints.  Writing the proposal and specifying according
objectives on a higher level has proved to be generally useful for clarifying
goals on a longer term. It also helps others to understand the project better. 

Unfortunately the negotiations with the EU got stuck in
organizational limbo and the project is still suffering from
the effects of this even today.  The goal of funding
contributors especially coming to sprints was originally
based on a non-profit association.  This solution
wasn't seen as realistic or feasible by the EU although
we think it remains a viable approach for the future.   During
negotiations, we got to an alternative solution which
had a few drawbacks:  contributors have to become Contract Partners within 
the EU-level Consortium (which is by itself not difficult) and can then at least
claim travel and accomodation costs when attending sprints.

However, this construction does not allow them to get paid for
work time and also has some formal requirements.  In practice this 
leads to current considerations of developers to shift private money
between them in order to circumvent the current problems with
implementing an agile model within the EU contract framing. 


Seven Organisations / The consortium 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The guiding idea for receiving funding is to have organisations 
in which key developers and other parties are employed. 
Two companies out of the seven organisations in the initial
consortium were funded during the EU negotiation process.
what first might have felt as an EU-related obstacle became an
opportunity, but with some overhead like legal and organizational 
responsibilities.  

Other adjustments and recruiting companies with previous EU
project experiences took place.  There also is one company 
involved quite unrelated to the previous developer work
but rather focused on process management and
designing learning processes with a background from the
Chaospilot school in Aarhus, Denmark.  When creating the formal
consortium of seven partners new cultures and perspectives
were mixed with the strong collaborative Open Source core
team, adding new complexities in communication and
cooperation.  Getting the new "playmates" to adopt the vision,
culture and spirit of the original idea and holding true to it
during the work on the proposal and negotiation process was a
challenge indeed.

The formal project organization required by the EU imposed
more structure on the previous more free-floating agile
process. Roles and responsibilities where staked out,
conforming with the requirements of the roles but delegating
as much as possible of the responsibilities and
decision-making to the core developers.  The strategy was to
keep "conceptual integrity" (Brooks) of the vision and the
idea in the hands of the core developers.  A somewhat negative
result was the added workload and responsibility on developers
regarding EU related work.  It is not too surprising that
the consortium with its member organisation now employs a
version-control/review based scheme regarding EU documents
reflecting the technical development approaches. 

It remains a challenge for all partners of the consortium,
universities and companies alike, to connect an ongoing
medium-scale open-source project with EU regulations and
requirements - not to speak of the fact that companies need to
fund 50% of the costs themselves.  It is, in fact, too early
to judge the overall success of our approaches although 
we are confident that things work out reasonably well. 


challenges: balancing community interests with EU requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The nature of sprints changed when EU funding started.  The
need to meet milestones of promised *deliverables* and the
goal to keep an open sprint process, still welcoming newcomers
into the world of Pypy, made the sprints longer (at least 7
days with a break day in the middle) but also changed the
nature of the sprints.  The team started to distuingish between
sprints open for all to attend, without any prior PyPy experience,
and sprints requiring earlier PyPy involvement.  Tutorials, start up
planning meetings as well as daily status meetings evolved,
the latest additions to the sprints are closing planning
meetings (planning the work between sprints) and work-groups -
a version of pair-programming in groups.

Some other effects of sprinting within the EU-structure is that the sprint
becomes a forum for non-development work - coordinating and tracking the
project. The challenge here is not affecting the main work and "disturbing"
visiting developers with EU-related work. It could also be argued that the
prolonged sprints could possibly make it more difficult for non consortium
members to attend the full time, disturbing other engagements etc. 

The project continues to try to adapt the method of sprinting, evaluating
feedback from sprint participants.  Maybe the implementation within the PyPy
team is slowly conforming to the Scrum standard of sprinting, but not as a
conscious effort?


Managing diversities: agile business 
--------------------------------------------------------------

For a diverse group of organisations and people, agility is
helpful at various levels: you cannot make all-encompassing
plans and hope to statically follow them and succeed.  New
developments, twists and opportunities evolve all the time.  

Our experience with evolving PyPy from a loose Open Source project
to a partially funded EU research project shows the following:

- what first seemed like too diverse interests and views,
  impossible to tailor into a single project, was instead a
  fruitful mix of diversities. The challenge is to manage
  these diversities and channel them into constructive team
  efforts.  Aiming for homogenity is the real threat.  

- what first seemed like unbeatable odds and too big obstacles
  sometimes even turned into new possibilities. The challenge is
  to maintain an atmosphere in which a team can act on those and
  within short timeframes of opportunities.  Change is
  inevitable - how you handle it is the real challenge.

- there are many other projects and organisations who are 
  heading in similar directions of trying to connect and
  evolve agile open source strategies with business matters. 
  Emerging models for developers distributed between
  different countries allows people with special interests
  to effectively work together and learn from each other. 

Concluding  - the cumulative effects of an agile, open and
dynamic team process combined with a market and curious
first adopters facilitates agile business.  A positive result 
is that a lot of people within the PyPy context found 
enjoyable jobs and there now already is evolving commercial
interest despite the still early stages of the project - mostly 
from US companies though ... why european companies, especially
larger ones, appear to prefer taking rather naive views on agile 
open-source development ("great, it's cheaper, no license fees!") 
is another interesting topic.
