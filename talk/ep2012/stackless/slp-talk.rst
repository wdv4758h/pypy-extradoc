The Story of Stackless Python
============================================


About This Talk
----------------

* first talk after a long break

  - *rst2beamer* for the first time

guest speaker:

* Herve Coatanhay about Nagare

  - PowerPoint (Mac)

|pause|

Meanwhile I used

* Powerpoint (PC)

* Keynote (Mac)

* Google Docs

|pause|

poll: What is your favorite slide tool?

What is Stackless?
-------------------

* *Stackless is a Python version that does not use the C stack*

  |pause|

  - really? naah
  
|pause|

* Stackless is a Python version that does not keep state on the C stack

  - the stack *is* used but
  
  - cleared between function calls

|pause|
  
* Remark:

  - theoretically. In practice...
  
  - ... it is reasonable 90 % of the time
  
  - we come back to this!


What is Stackless about?
-------------------------

* it is like CPython

|pause|

* it can do a little bit more

|pause|

* adds a single builtin module

|pause|

|scriptsize|
|example<| |>|

  .. sourcecode:: python
  
    import stackless
    
|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|

|pause|

* is like an extension

  - but, sadly, not really
  
  - stackless **must** be builtin  
  
  - **but:** there is a solution...


Now, what is it really about?
------------------------------

* have tiny little "main" programs

  - ``tasklet``
  
|pause|

* tasklets communicate via messages

  - ``channel``
  
|pause|

* tasklets are often called ``microthreads``

  - but there are no threads at all
  
  - only one tasklets runs at any time

|pause|

* *but see the PyPy STM* approach

  - this will apply to tasklets as well


Cooperative Multitasking ...
-------------------------------

|scriptsize|
|example<| |>|

  .. sourcecode:: pycon
  
    >>> import stackless
    >>>
    >>> channel = stackless.channel()
    
|pause|

  .. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> def receiving_tasklet():
    ...     print "Receiving tasklet started"
    ...     print channel.receive()
    ...     print "Receiving tasklet finished"

|pause|

  .. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> def sending_tasklet():
    ...     print "Sending tasklet started"
    ...     channel.send("send from sending_tasklet")
    ...     print "sending tasklet finished"

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|


... Cooperative Multitasking ...
---------------------------------

|scriptsize|
|example<| |>|

  .. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> def another_tasklet():
    ...     print "Just another tasklet in the scheduler"

|pause|

  .. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> stackless.tasklet(receiving_tasklet)()
    <stackless.tasklet object at 0x00A45B30>
    >>> stackless.tasklet(sending_tasklet)()
    <stackless.tasklet object at 0x00A45B70>
    >>> stackless.tasklet(another_tasklet)()
    <stackless.tasklet object at 0x00A45BF0>
    
|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|


... Cooperative Multitasking
-------------------------------

|scriptsize|
|example<| |>|
    
  .. sourcecode:: pycon

    <stackless.tasklet object at 0x00A45B70>
    >>> stackless.tasklet(another_tasklet)()
    <stackless.tasklet object at 0x00A45BF0>
    >>>
    >>> stackless.run()
    Receiving tasklet started
    Sending tasklet started
    send from sending_tasklet
    Receiving tasklet finished
    Just another tasklet in the scheduler
    sending tasklet finished

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|


Why not just the *greenlet* ?
-------------------------------

* greenlets are a subset of stackless

  - can partially emulate stackless
  
  - there is no builtin scheduler
  
  - technology quite close to Stackless 2.0
  
|pause|

* greenlets are about 10x slower to switch context because
  using only hard-switching
  
  - but that's ok in most cases
    
|pause|

* greenlets are kind-of perfect

  - near zero maintenace
  
  - minimal interface

|pause|

* but the main difference is ...


Pickling Program State
-----------------------

|scriptsize|
|example<| Persistence (p. 1 of 2) |>|

  .. sourcecode:: python

    import pickle, sys
    import stackless
    
    ch = stackless.channel()
    
    def recurs(depth, level=1):
        print 'enter level %s%d' % (level*'  ', level)
        if level >= depth:
            ch.send('hi')
        if level < depth:
            recurs(depth, level+1)
        print 'leave level %s%d' % (level*'  ', level)

|end_example|

# *remember to show it interactively*

|end_scriptsize|


Pickling Program State
-----------------------

|scriptsize|

|example<| Persistence (p. 2 of 2) |>|

  .. sourcecode:: python


    def demo(depth):
        t = stackless.tasklet(recurs)(depth)
        print ch.receive()
        pickle.dump(t, file('tasklet.pickle', 'wb'))
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        if len(sys.argv) > 1:
            t = pickle.load(file(sys.argv[1], 'rb'))
            t.insert()
        else:
            t = stackless.tasklet(demo)(9)
        stackless.run()


|end_example|

# *remember to show it interactively*

Greenlet vs. Stackless
-----------------------

* Greenlet is a pure extension module

  - but performance is good enough

|pause|

* Stackless can pickle program state

  - but stays a replacement of Python

|pause|

* Greenlet never can, as an extension

|pause|

* *easy installation* lets people select greenlet over stackless

  - see for example the *eventlet* project
  
  - *but there is a simple work-around, we'll come to it*

|pause|

* *they both have their application domains
  and they will persist.*


Why Stackless makes a Difference
---------------------------------

* Microthreads ?

  - the feature where I put most effort into
  
  |pause|

  - can be emulated: (in decreasing speed order)
  
    - generators (incomplete, "half-sided")
  
    - greenlet
    
    - threads (even ;-)

|pause|

* Pickling program state ! ==

|pause|

* **persistence**


Persistence, Cloud Computing
-----------------------------

* freeze your running program

* let it continue anywhere else

  - on a different computer
  
  - on a different operating system (!)
  
  - in a cloud
  
* migrate your running program

* save snapshots, have checkpoints

  - without doing any extra-work

Software archeology
-------------------

* Around since 1998

  - version 1
  
    - using only soft-switching
    
    - continuation-based
  
    - *please let me skip old design errors :-)*

|pause|

* Complete redesign in 2002

  - version 2
  
    - using only hard-switching
    
    - birth of tasklets and channels

|pause|

* Concept merge in 2004

  - version 3
  
    - **80-20** rule:
    
    - soft-switching whenever possible
      
    - hard-switching if foreign code is on the stack
      
  - these 80 % can be *pickled*  (90?)

* This stayed as version 3.1

Status of Stackless Python
---------------------------

* mature

* Python 2 and Python 3, all versions

* maintained by

  - Richard Tew
  - Kristjan Valur Jonsson
  - me  (a bit)


The New Direction for Stackless
-------------------------------

* ``pip install stackless-python``

  - will install ``slpython``
  - or even ``python``     (opinions?)

|pause|

* drop-in replacement of CPython
  *(psssst)*

|pause|

* ``pip uninstall stackless-python``

  - Stackless is a bit cheating, as it replaces the python binary
  
  - but the user perception will be perfect
  
* *trying stackless made easy!*


New Direction (cont'd)
-----------------------

* first prototype yesterday from

  Anselm Kruis       *(applause)*

  - works on Windows

  |pause|

  - OS X

    - I'll do that one

  |pause|
  
  - Linux

    - soon as well

|pause|

* being very careful to stay compatible

  - python 2.7.3 installs stackless for 2.7.3
  - python 3.2.3 installs stackless for 3.2.3
  
  - python 2.7.2 : *please upgrade*
    - or maybe have an over-ride option?

Consequences of the Pseudo-Package
-----------------------------------

The technical effect is almost nothing.

The psycological impact is probably huge:

|pause|

* stackless is easy to install and uninstall

|pause|

* people can simply try if it fits their needs

|pause|

* the never ending discussion

  - "Why is Stackless not included in the Python core?"

|pause|

* **has ended**

  - "Why should we, after all?"

  |pause|

  - hey Guido :-)

  - what a relief, for you and me
  

Status of Stackless PyPy
---------------------------

* was completely implemented before the Jit

  - together with
    greenlets
    coroutines
    
  - not Jit compatible
    
* was "too complete" with a 30% performance hit

* new approach is almost ready

  - with full Jit support
  - but needs some fixing
  - this *will* be efficient

Applications using Stackless Python
------------------------------------

* The Eve Online MMORPG

  http://www.eveonline.com/
  
  - based their games on Stackless since 1998

* science + computing ag, Anselm Kruis

  https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/p/anselm-kruis

* The Nagare Web Framework

  http://www.nagare.org/
  
  - works because of Stackless Pickling

* today's majority: persistence
