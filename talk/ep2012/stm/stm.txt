Problem
-------

  Python is slow-ish, by some factor N

  (Python / other lang) ~= N ~= constant over time

  CPU speed used to grow exponentially, but no longer

  one program written in Python runs on one core only

  which means that one program written in Python will in the future run
  exponentially slower, when compared with "other lang"

  does not matter for all programs... or does it?  think about it this way:

    1. my script runs anyway in 0.1 seconds.

       Yes, but what if you were running it on 2002 hardware?  it would take
       3 seconds.  On 1982 hardware?  One hour.  So if the CPU speed growth
       stop had occurred in 1982 already, then your script would still take
       one hour today to run in Python.  (Or half an hour thanks to the
       continuing hard work of a dedicated core team...)

    2. I can use other solutions involving launching multiple processes
       and exchanging data between them.

       Yes, which is fine.  For some problems it is the "correct"
       solution (highly independent computations, separation for
       security, etc.).  But for some other problems it doesn't apply or
       at least not easily.  Imagine a Python without GC.  You can of
       course handle manually allocating and freeing objects, like in
       C++.  But you're missing a vast simplification that you get for
       free in Python.


This presentation is not about removing the GIL
-----------------------------------------------

GIL: Global Interpreter Lock

  --[XX]-----[XX]----[XX]------->
  ------[XXX]----[XX]----[XX]--->

pypy-stm is a Python without the GIL, the fourth in this category:

 - Python 1.4 patch by Greg Stein in 1996
 - Jython
 - IronPython

Demo pypy-stm

No JIT integration so far, about 4x slower than a JIT-less PyPy

"STM" = Software Transactional Memory: similar to databases: every core
runs "transactions" that are committed to main memory at the end:

  --[XX][XX][XX]---->
  --[XXX][XX][XX]--->

Occasionally, some transactions fail if they happen to conflict with
transactions committed by other cores:

  --[XX][XX][XX]--------->
  --[XXX][XX**[XX][XX]--->

Some hardware support (HTM) coming in 2013 (Intel's Haswell CPU),
which promizes to make it easy to do the same with CPython

So removing the GIL is suddenly around the corner


The catch
---------

You have to use threads


Threads
-------

Threads are messy to use correctly

Similar to doing explicit memory management: I would like my program to
figure it automatically, not have to worry about it every single line of
code.

Debugging a race condition is a nightmare, totally non-reproductible.


This presentation is really about this new feature
--------------------------------------------------

Demo: pypy-stm using the "transaction" module

Demo how to insert usage of it in pypy/rpython/rtyper.py


What you get
------------

A fool-proof API that gives multicore usages *without using threads*

Implemented in pypy-stm --- slowly, but who cares? :-)  when you have
an unlimited supply of cores...  (ok, I agree we care anyway.)

How?
----

Same as above, but with longer, controlled transactions.

If we ask the `transaction` module to run f(1), f(2) and f(3), it starts
N threads and run each of f(1), f(2) and f(3) in its own transaction.

We would get this with the GIL (pointlessly using two cores):

  --[run f(1)]----------[run f(3)]---->
  ------------[run f(2)]-------------->

But with STM with get:

  --[run f(1)][run f(3)]---->
  --[run f(2)]-------------->

With STM we get what *appears* to be same effect as with the GIL,
while *actually* running on multiple cores concurrently, as long
as the transactions don't conflict with each other.


What about CPython?
-------------------

HTM coming in Intel's Haswell CPU is not going to be enough at all for
this.  It'll eventually get there, but in how many years?  and how many
more years before we can assume that every CPU out there has it?

In the meantime there seem to be no move from the CPython core
developers to try to implement STM.  It would also be a major undertaking.

So the future looks to me like this:

* option 1: (CPython / other lang) will go down exponentially until the
  point, in 10-20 years, where HTM is good enough for CPython.  A "dark
  age" of CPython, speed-wise...

* option 2: to use HTM anyway, everyone will have to write (and debug)
  their Python programs using threads.  That's a "dark age" of the
  high-level Python language...


Summary
-------

* "Transactional Memory" is the first technique that seems to work
  for multi-core Python programs

* Can be implemented in software (STM), but is slow (and unlikely on CPython)

* Will be soon available in a JITting pypy-stm

* In the next few years, hardware support (HTM) will show up

* Either programmed with threads, or with much easier models based on longer
  transactions

* But capacity limitations of HTM make it unlikely to support really long
  transactions before many more years
