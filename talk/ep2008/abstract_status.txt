Quick summary of cool features of pypy, where we are now and where we are going.

Abstract
========

This talk will try to explain to broader public status of the PyPy project,
where we are and where we are going. We're going to show some demos of
cool features, but also we're going to run real applications on top of pypy
to showcase how complaint our python interpreter is.

This talk will not cover any internal details (or at least not that many :),
which will be covered by different talk.

45 minutes.
