Title: PyPy: Dynamic optimizations for your favorite language

Talker: Armin Rigo

Abstract (max 150 words):

    PyPy (http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/architecture.html) is
    an implementation of the Python (http://www.python.org) programming
    language written in Python itself, flexible and easy to experiment
    with.  We are targeting a large variety of platforms, small and
    large, by providing a compiler toolsuite that can produce custom
    Python versions.  Platform, memory and threading models are aspects
    of the translation process - as opposed to encoding low level
    details into the language implementation itself.

    The talk will give a quick overview of this toolsuite, which is so
    far a static type inferencer and compiler for RPython, a subset of
    Python.  I will then talk about the current work on dynamic
    optimization techniques: implemented as another translation aspect,
    they should become robust against language changes.  In other words,
    the toolsuite will be able to turn an interpreter for any language
    or dialect into a just-in-time compiler - more exactly, a
    "just-in-time specializer", like Psyco for the Python language
    (http://psyco.sf.net).
