We present a timeline of events that happened during last year.

Highlights:

* February 2009 (a year ago!) - we merge a very experimental JIT approach
  into PyPy.

* March 2009 - speeding up the first example, function counting integers.

  i = 0
  while i < 10000000:
   i = i + 1

* June 2009 - solved problem with Python frames, how to avoid using them
  in most common cases.

* July 2009 - XXX [maybe] numeric experiments

* August 2009 - Benjamin Peterson rewrites PyPy compiler, a lot of work,
  little visibility outside.

* September 2009 - We manage to speed up Richards, the first non-trivial
  benchmark on top of PyPy JIT.

* October 2009 - [XXX kill?] Improvements to the GC, float support.  Antonio
  finally finishes to port the JIT to CLI: the resulting pypy-cli-jit is
  faster than IronPython on a couple of benchmarks, including Richards.

* November 2009 - We publish results on computer language shootout
  benchmarks, looking mostly good, with bad places.

* December 2009 - Christmas :-)

* January 2010 - Solved the issue of chaining frames, so exceptions can
  be fast.

* January 2010 - Nightly run of benchmarks, looking like this: xxx

* February 2010 - JIT achieves a level of stability comparable to CPython.
  (or baseline pypy???)

* March 2010 - 1.2 release - a release to try out JIT and gather feedback
