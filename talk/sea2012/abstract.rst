Fast numeric in Python - NumPy and PyPy
=======================================

Python increasingly is being utilized as a powerful scientific
processing language. It successfully has been used as a glue language
to drive simulations written in C, Fortran or the array
manipulation language provided by the NumPy package.  Originally
Python only was used as a glue language because the original Python
implementation was relatively slow. With the recent progress in the
PyPy project that is showing significant performance
improvements in each release, Python is nearing performance comparable
to native C language implementations. In this talk I will
describe three stages: how to use it right now, in the near future and
our plans to provide a very robust infrastructure for implementing
numerical computations. I also will spend some time exploring ideas
how dynamic compilation eventually can outperform static compilation
and how a high-level language helps accomplish this.
