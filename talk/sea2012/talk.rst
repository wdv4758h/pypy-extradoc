Fast numeric in Python - NumPy and PyPy
=======================================

What is this talk about?
------------------------

* What is PyPy and why?

* Numeric landscape in Python

* What we achieved in PyPy

* Where we're going?

What is PyPy?
-------------

* **An efficient implementation of Python language**

* A framework for writing efficient dynamic language implementations

* An open source project with a lot of volunteer effort, released under the BSD license

* I'll talk today about the first part (mostly)

PyPy status right now
---------------------

* An **efficient just in time compiler** for the Python language

* Relatively "good' on numerics (compared to other dynamic languages)

* Example - real time video processing

* XXX some benchmarks

Why should you care?
--------------------

* *If I write this stuff in C/fortran/assembler it'll be faster anyway*

* maybe, but ...

Why should you care? (2)
------------------------

* Experimentation is important

* Implementing something faster, in **human time**, leaves more time for optimizations and improvements

* For novel algorithms, clearer implementation makes them easier to evaluate (Python often is cleaner than C)

|pause|

* Sometimes makes it **possible** in the first place

Why would you care even more?
-----------------------------

* Growing community

* Everything is for free with reasonable licensing

* There are many smart people out there addressing hard problems

Example of why would you care
-----------------------------

* You spend a year writing optimized algorithms for a GPU

* Next year a new generation of GPUs come along

* Your algorithms are no longer optimized

|pause|

* Alternative - **express** your algorithms

* Leave low-level details to people who have nothing better to do

|pause|

* ... like me (I don't know enough Physics to do the other part)

Numerics in Python
------------------

* ``numpy`` - for array operations

* ``scipy``, ``scikits`` - various algorithms, also exposing C/fortran
  libraries

* ``matplotlib`` - pretty pictures

* ``ipython``

There is an entire ecosystem!
-----------------------------

* Which I don't even know very well

* ``PyCUDA``

* ``pandas``

* ``mayavi``

What's important?
-----------------

* There is an entire ecosystem built by people

* It's available for free, no shady licensing

* It's being expanded

* It's growing

* It'll keep up with hardware advancments

Problems with numerics in python
--------------------------------

* Stuff is reasonably fast, but...

|pause|

* Only if you don't actually write much **Python**

* Array operations are fine as long as they're vectorized

* Not everything is expressable that way

* Numpy allocates intermediates for each operation, suboptimal

Our approach
------------

* Build a tree of operations

XXX a tree picture

* Compile assembler specialized for aliasing and operations

* Execute the specialized assembler

Examples
--------

* ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` are single dimensional arrays

* ``a+a`` would generate different code than ``a+b``

* ``a+b*c`` is as fast as a loop

Performance comparison
----------------------

XXX

Status
------

* This works reasonably well

* Far from implementing the entire numpy, although it's in progress

* Assembler generation backend needs works

* Vectorization in progress

Status benchmarks - trivial stuff
---------------------------------

XXX

Status benchmarks - slightly more complex
-----------------------------------------

* laplace solution

* solutions:

  XXX laplace numbers
  +---+
  |   |
  +---+

Progress plan
-------------

* Express operations in high-level languages

* Let us deal with low level details

|pause|

* However, retain knobs and buttons for advanced users

* Don't get penalized too much for not using them

Few words about the future
--------------------------

* Predictions are hard

|pause|

* Especially when it comes to future

* Take this with a grain of salt

This is just the beginning...
-----------------------------

* PyPy is an easy platform to experiment with

* We did not spend a whole lot of time dealing with the low-level optimizations

* Automatic vectorization over multiple threads

* SSE, GPU, dynamic offloading

* Optimizations based on machine cache size

* We're running a fundraiser, make your employer donate money 

Extra - SSE preliminary results
-------------------------------
