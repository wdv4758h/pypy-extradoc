Fast numeric in Python - NumPy and PyPy
=======================================

What is this talk about?
------------------------

* What is PyPy and why?

* Numeric landscape in python

* What we achieved in PyPy?

* Where we're going?

What is PyPy?
-------------

* **An efficient implementation of Python language**

* A framework for writing efficient dynamic language implementations

* An open source project with a lot of volunteer effort

* I'll talk today about the first part (mostly)

PyPy status right now
---------------------

* An **efficient just in time compiler** for the Python language

* Relatively "good" on numerics (compared to other dynamic languages)

* Example - real time video processing

* Some comparisons

Why would you care?
-------------------

* "If I write this stuff in C/fortran/assembler it'll be faster anyway"

* maybe, but ...

Why would you care (2)
----------------------

* Experimentation is important

* Implementing something faster, in human time, leaves more time for optimizations and improvements

* For novel algorithms, being clearly expressed in code makes them easier to evaluate (Python is cleaner than C often)

Why would you care even more
----------------------------

* Growing community

* Everything is for free with reasonable licensing

* There are many smart people out there addressing hard problems

Example why would you care
--------------------------

* You spend a year writing optimized algorithms for a GPU

* Next year a new generation of GPUs come along

* Your algorithms are no longer optimize

|pause|

* Alternative - express your algorithms

* Leave low-level details for people who have nothing better to do

|pause|

* Like me (I don't know enough physics to do the other part)

Numerics in Python
------------------

* ``numpy`` - for array operations

* ``scipy``, ``scikits`` - various algorithms, also exposing C/fortran
  libraries

* ``matplotlib`` - pretty pictures

* ``ipython``

There is an entire ecosystem!
-----------------------------

* Which I don't even know very well

* ``PyCUDA``

* ``pandas``

* ``mayavi``

What's important?
-----------------

* There is an entire ecosystem built by people

* It's available for free, no shady licensing

* It's being expanded

* It's growing

* It'll keep up with hardware advancments

Problems with numerics in python
--------------------------------

* Stuff is reasonably fast, but...

* Only if you don't actually write much Python

* Array operations are fine as long as they're vectorized

* Not everything is expressable that way

* Numpy allocates intermediates for each operation, trashing caches

Our approach
------------

* Build a tree of operations

* Compile assembler specialized for aliasing and operations

* Execute the specialized assembler

Examples
--------

* ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` are single dimensional arrays

* ``a + a`` would generate different code than ``a + b``

* ``a + b * c`` is as fast as a loop

Status
------

* This works reasonably well

* Far from implementing the entire numpy, although it's in progress

* Assembler generation backend needs works

* Vectorization in progress

Status benchmarks - trivial stuff
---------------------------------

Status benchmarks - slightly more complex
-----------------------------------------

* laplace solution

* solutions:

Progress plan
-------------

* Express operations in high-level languages

* Let us deal with low level details

|pause|

* However, leave knobs and buttons for advanced users

* Don't get penalized too much for not using them

Few words about the future
--------------------------

* Predictions are hard

|pause|

* Especially when it comes to future

* Take this with a grain of salt

This is just the beginning...
-----------------------------

* PyPy is an easy platform to experiment with

* We did not spend a whole lot of time dealing with the low-level optimizations

Extra - SSE preliminary results
-------------------------------
