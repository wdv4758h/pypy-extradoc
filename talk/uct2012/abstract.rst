Building fast enough VMs in fast enough time
============================================

PyPy is a fast interpreter for the Python programming language. This however,
not the whole description. It's also a framework for building efficient
Virtual Machines for dynamic languages with relatively little effort.

In this talk I would like to walk people through how the unique
infrastructure provided by the PyPy project let's you write efficient
virtual machines with minimal effort. This talk will cover the
architecture of the PyPy project, how to use it in your own VMs as
well as how to hook up an efficient garbage collector and Just In Time
compiler with minimal effort.

This talk assumes no prior exposure to compiler techniques and assumes
some very basic knowledge of the Python programming language.
