Title: PyPy - status and next goals 

Abstract: I'd like to present the status and next goals of
the PyPy project: both a platform for implementing dynamic languages
and a complete Python Interpreter written in a high level language.  
PyPy translates interpreters to C, .NET and the JVM.  The talk will 
focus on what is new since the last RuPy conference.  I am going to 
talk about speed and feature improvements, particularly our flexible
garbage collection framework and the Just-in-time compiler generator. 
This generator is used to automatically turn our Python interpreter 
into a compiler for directly emitting assembler code.
