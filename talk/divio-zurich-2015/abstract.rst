PyPy is a fast and compliant alternative implementation for the Python
programming language. In this talk I would like to present PyPy, it's goals,
it's history and the current status of running real world Python code.
The talk will cover some architectural details like the implementation
of our Just in Time compiler as well a bit more esoteric features like Software
Transactional Memory, which promises to provide a GIL less PyPy. It'll also
contain a fair bit about benchmarking and how to port/move your code to
PyPy based on a case study.

Maciej Fijalkowski is a long time PyPy core developer, running a consulting
business around PyPy, baroquesoftware.com. He has been involved in various
pieces of PyPy, including garbage collector, just in time compiler,
assembler generation etc.
