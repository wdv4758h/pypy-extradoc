=============================
PyPy meets Python 3 and Numpy
=============================


Abstract
========

PyPy is an alternative Python implementation whose JIT often gives
seriously better performance than CPython.  Now PyPy supports, in beta
version, two major new application domains: Python 3.x, and Numpy and
the rest of the scientific stack.  These are each an important milestone
for a subset of the Python community.

This talk is about what's new in PyPy in the last couple of years,
including these two topics.



Long version
============

PyPy is an alternative Python implementation whose JIT often gives
seriously better performance than CPython. Now PyPy supports, in beta
version, two major new application domains: Python 3.x, and Numpy and
the rest of the scientific stack. These are each an important milestone
for a subset of the Python community.

- Thanks to a grant by Mozilla, "PyPy3" now largely supports Python 3.5
  with one or two extensions from Python 3.6. Full support should be
  very close. (Note that PyPy2 will not disappear, if only because PyPy
  itself is written in Python 2.7.)

- Numpy and the major packages of the scientific stack are now starting
  to work well with PyPy (PyPy2 mostly, but also PyPy3). This is thanks
  to progress in "cpyext" emulating the CPython C API, as well as fixes
  to the packages in collaboration with the upstream developers.

This talk is about what's new in PyPy in the last couple of years,
including these two topics.
