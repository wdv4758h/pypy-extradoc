Psyco
    http://psyco.sourceforge.net

This presentation requires Python and Pygame to run.
See http://www.pygame.org/ to install Pygame on your system.
Execute accu.py to start the presentation.  Tested on a Linux
box, it should hopefully work on any platform.

The document accu2004-psyco.txt is included in case it is
of interest to you, as it contains a few things not found in
the interactive presentation.  On the other hand, the
equivalent of the animated parts are pretty obscure in the
text file.
