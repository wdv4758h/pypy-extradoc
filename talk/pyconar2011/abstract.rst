Little things that PyPy makes possible
======================================

PyPy is just a python interpreter. However, there are things that were not
quite possible to do with Python, like real time video processing, because
of Python interpreter limitations. This is no longer the case -- I'll present
few demos and explain details of those little things that run on PyPy that
make python an even more awesome language than it was before.
