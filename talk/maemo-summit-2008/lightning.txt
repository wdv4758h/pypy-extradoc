PyPy Python on Maemo 
================================

What is PyPy? 
===================================

* Python Interpreter written in (R)Python 

* framework for implementing dynamic languages

* goal: new deal on flexibility and speed 

Why yet another Python interpreter?
===================================

* single source translated to C/LLVM/JVM/.NET 

* highly compatible to CPython

* super-fast JIT Compilation (in-progress)

* metaprogramming: Waaaay easier to experiment with

* sandboxing, transparent proxies, ... 

PyPy-c on Maemo / expectations 
=====================================

* faster startup time (starts from image)
* Less per-object memory overhead (new GCs)
* more robust (built-in)
* high potential for optimizations 
* run multiple Pythons efficiently 
* but: slower (0.8-4) for now
* but: higher interpreter base size for now

PyPy-c on Maemo / status
========================

* working on benchmarking memory and startup time
* working on cross-compilation (scratchbox)
* first pypy-c starts up on device 
* plan for next months: 
  * fully working pypy-c/maemo 
  * extensive benchmarking
  * some optimizations, maybe new GC 

Garbage Collectors 
========================

* PyPy has pluggable garbage collectors 

* why not come up with something embedded friendly?

* Impossible in CPython optimizations

* reusable for other language implementations! 

JIT
===

* In progress for x86

* Why not run on ARM as well?

* speed/memory tradeoffs ?!

Multiple interpreters
=====================

* goal: run multiple Python processes efficiently 

* Again, pluggable GCs

* Share some static data (pyc files, modules, etc.)
