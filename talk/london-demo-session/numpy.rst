================================
Numpy on PyPy status and roadmap
================================

Goals
-----

* fully compliant numpy replacement for PyPy

* fast looped operations

* fast vectorized operations

Why?
----

* fast looping

* single language

Model
-----

* some programs have numerical kernels that can be written in C

* some don't

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1334

* image manipulation demo

* abstraction unfriendly

Status
------

* fast looped operations

* ok vectorized operations

Future goals
------------

* finish numpy

* make it fast

* make it compatible with more software (matplotlib, scipy)

Funding
-------

* about $20k left

* we likely need more

* behind schedule, but not behind budget

Q&A
---

* Thank you!
