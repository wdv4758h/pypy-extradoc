PyPy training session
=====================

Part 1 (2 hours): Run your application under PyPy
--------------------------------------------------

- how to use pypy to run your app (easy: s/python/pypy :-))

- how to optimize it for the pypy jit:

      * general idea about how the jit works

      * looking at the traces

      * using the jitviewer

      * tweaking jit and gc params

- how to compile C extensions for pypy, and fix them if necessary


Part 2 (2 hours): Write your own interpreter with PyPy
-------------------------------------------------------

- give the students the source code of a toy language interpreter of written
  in RPython

- teach them how to translate it

- teach them about the JIT hints

- challenge: place hints (or maybe even refactor the interpreter) to get the
  best results with the JIT

- do we still have a PyPy T-shirt to give as a prize to the winner? :)
