==================================
Python performance characteristics
==================================

Who am I?
---------

* Maciej Fija≈Çkowski (yes this is unicode)

* PyPy core developer for I don't remember

* performance freak

What this talk is about?
------------------------

* python performance (or lack of it)

* why does it matter

* what can we do about it

|pause|

* how Python implementations work

How does CPython work?
----------------------

* simple bytecode interpreter

* each bytecode looks up in a list, executes

* most operations have dynamic dispatch on types

CPython performance landscape
-----------------------------

* each operation has a cost

* C is cheaper than Python

* use ``map`` vs iterations etc.

Python performance message
---------------------------

* according to Guido

* "Avoid overengineering datastructures. Tuples are better than objects (try namedtuple too though). Prefer simple fields over getter/setter functions."

* "Built-in datatypes are your friends. Use more numbers, strings, tuples, lists, sets, dicts. Also check out the collections library, esp. deque."

* "Be suspicious of function/method calls; creating a stack frame is expensive."

* "The universal speed-up is rewriting small bits of code in C. Do this only when all else fails."

What does it mean?
------------------

* don't use abstractions

|pause|

* don't use Python

But also
--------

* measure!

* there are so many variables, you cannot care without benchmarks

|pause|

* if you have no benchmarks, you don't care

This is not how I want to write software
----------------------------------------

* I like my abstractions

* I like Python

* I don't want to rewrite stuff for performance

|pause|

* in C/C++

Second best
-----------

* keep my abstractions

* do arcane voodoo to keep my programs fast

* but you have to understand the voodo in the first place

But Python performance!
-----------------------

* there is no such thing as language performance

* there is implementation performance

* the language might be easier or harder to optimize

* CPython performance characteristics is relatively straightforward

What is PyPy?
-------------

* PyPy is a Python interpreter (that's what we care about)

* PyPy is a toolchain for creating dynamic language implementations

* also, an Open Source project that has been around for a while

Compilers vs interpreters
-------------------------

* compilers compile language X (C, Python) to a lower level language
  (C, assembler) ahead of time

* interpreters compile language X to bytecode and have a big interpreter
  loop

|pause|

* PyPy has a hybrid approach. It's an interpreter, but hot paths are
  compiled directly to assembler during runtime

What is just in time (JIT) compilation?
---------------------------------------

* few different flavors

* observe runtime values

* compile code with agressive optimizations

* have checks if assumptions still stand

So what PyPy does?
------------------

* interprets a Python program

* the JIT observes python **interpreter**

* producing code through the path followed by the interpreter

* compiles loops and functions

Some properties
---------------

* the code speed **changes** over time

* hopefully from slow to fast

* you need to warm up things before they get fast

Some example
------------

* integer addition!

Abstractions
------------

* inlining, malloc removal

* abstractions are cheap

|pause|

* if they don't introduce too much complexity

Questions?
----------

* Thank you!

* http://pypy.org

* http://baroquesoftware.com

Few words about garbage collection
----------------------------------

* ``CPython``: refcounting + cyclic collector

* ``PyPy``: generational mark & sweep

|pause|

* errr....

The rest
--------

* I'll explain various PyPy strategies

* ideally all this knowledge will be unnecessary

* this is the second best, how to please the JIT compiler

Allocations (PyPy)
------------------

* allocation is expensive

* for a good GC, short living objects don't matter

* it's better to have a small persistent structure and abstraction
  on allocation

|pause|

* copying however is expensive

* we have hacks for strings, but they're not complete

Calls
-----

* Python calls are an incredible mess

* simple is better than complex

* simple call comes with no cost, the cost grows with growing complexity

Attribute access
----------------

* if optimized, almost as fast as local var access

* ``dict`` lookup optimized away

* class attributes considered constant

* meta programming is better than dynamism

* objects for small number of constant keys, dicts for large
  numbers of changing keys

Other sorts of loops
--------------------

* there is more!

* ``tuple(iterable)``, ``map(iterable)``, ``re.search``

* they're all jitted

* not all nicely

Summary
-------

* we hope this knowledge will not be needed

* the more you care, the better you need to know
