Status of PyPy
==============

:Author: Maciej Fijalkowski, merlinux GmbH
:Title: PyPy from the user perspective
:Date: 16 March 2008

Next half an hour
=================

* PyPy motivation and status

* What we're working on

* A few examples of why it works

* Where we're going

* Why you should not use RPython

* Implementation details available on Sunday evening

PyPy - motivation
=================================

* CPython is nice, but not flexible enough

* IronPython, Jython - bound to the specific VM

* Separate language specification from low-level details,
  such as GC or platform to run

* Psyco and Stackless Python hard to maintain

PyPy - user motivation
=======================

* One should never be forced to write anything in C
  for performance reasons (with some exceptions: embedded
  devices etc.)

* Just-in-time compiler should make number-crunching
  and static-enough code fast enough

* One should never care about low-level details

Status of PyPy
==============

* Very compliant language (to Python version 2.4/2.5)

* Some modules from the stdlib are missing, no 3rd party
  modules at all

* Recent development - ctypes

Status of PyPy backends
=======================

* We can compile to C and LLVM including threads (GIL),
  stackless (but not both), different GCs and all modules

* We can compile to CLI and JVM with a reduced set of modules,
  no threads

* Some bindings to .NET for CLI, working on getting
  Java libraries to the JVM PyPy

Status of speed in PyPy
=======================

* Hard to find decent python-only benchmarks in the wild

* Pystone 1.5, Richards 1., gcbench 0.9 (compared to CPython version 2.5)

* Real world apps usually 1.5-2., sometimes as slow as 3x.

Pystone speed over time

.. XXX make sure you explain this while keeping in mind
   that all texts in this image are probably too small
   to be read by people

Richards speed over time

Status of JIT in PyPy
=====================

* A lot of work has happened

* Even more needs to happen

* If your problem is similiar enough to counting Fibonacci numbers,
  we're as fast as psyco

* PyPy's JIT is way easier to extend than psyco (think PPC, think 64 bit,
  think floats)

Sandboxing
==========

* we analyze interpreter source (not user code) for
  all external function calls and replace them with stubs

* small piece of code to trust (no worry about 3rd party modules
  or whatever)

* very flexible policy

* extra run-time checks for all possible buffer overflows
  in interpreter source (still, not analyzing any user code)

* cannot segfault (unlike CPython)

.. XXX maybe put sandboxed.png on its own page and make it
   twice bigger for readability

More about sandboxing
======================

Transparent proxy
===================================

* app-level code for controlling behavior of
  any type (even frames or tracebacks)

* very similiar concept to the  .NET VM transparent
  proxy

* demo

Distribution prototype
=========================================

* a very simple distribution protocol built
  on top of a transparent proxy

* done in smalltalk in the 70s

* can work on any type, so you can
  raise a remote traceback and everything will be fine

* nice experiment, ~700 lines of code

* demo

Distribution diagram
=====================

RPython
=======

* In short - syntax of Python, restrictions of Java, error
  messages as readable as MUMPS

* The static subset of Python which we used for implementing the
  interpreter

* Our compiler toolchain analyzes RPython (i.e. interpreter source code,
  like C), not the user program

* Our interpreter is a "normal Python" interpreter

* Only PyPy implementers should know anything about RPython

RPython (2)
===========

* It's not a general purpose language

* One has to have a very good reason to use it

* Clunky error messages

* It's fast, it is pleasant not to code in C

* Ideally, our JIT will achieve the same level of speed

RPython - language
==================

* It's high level but only convenient if you want to write interpreters :-)

* Usually tons of metaprogramming

* Like C++ - you can write books about tricks

* Hard to extend

PyPy - future
=============

* Making 3rd party modules run on PyPy - you can help,
  notably by porting some to ctypes

* Making different programs run on PyPy - you can help,
  even just by trying and telling us

* We're thinking about providing different ways of getting
  3rd party modules

PyPy - JIT future
=================

* A lot of work happening (demos on Sunday)

* Short term goal - more general Python programs seeing speedups

* Machine code backend: needs support for floats, better assembler

* A lot of benchmarking and tweaking

* Yes, you can help as well
