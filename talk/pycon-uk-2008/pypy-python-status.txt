PyPy's Python status and plans
====================================

In this talk we'd like to discuss the status and plans 
for the near and mid-term future of PyPy's Python Interpreter,
particularly its upcoming 1.1 release.  We'll look at what 
kind of applications you can already run and where more
work and help is needed.  The talk also aims to clarify what 
is the "PyPy technology cloud".  There also should be room to 
discuss and demo some current highlights such as PyPy's 
robust virtualization/sandboxing approach for Python programs. 

level: beginner to intermediate
