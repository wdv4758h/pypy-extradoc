PyPy Python Interpreter status 
================================

What this talk is about
=======================

* a bit of motivation

* tell what Python Interpreter can run today 

* what we are heading for with the 1.1 release 

* Questions and Answers 

PyPy - motivation
=================================

* CPython is nice, but not flexible enough

* IronPython, Jython - bound to the specific VM

* Separate language specification from low-level details,
  such as GC or platform to run

* Psyco and Stackless Python hard to maintain

PyPy - user motivation
=======================

* One should never be forced to write anything in C
  for performance reasons (with some exceptions: embedded
  devices etc.)

* Just-in-time compiler should make number-crunching
  and static-enough code fast enough

* One should never care about low-level details

Brief history of PyPy
==========================

* first sprint 2003, about 30 more by now
* CPython/Psyco/Jython/Stackless developers participating
* MIT-License, more sprints
* EU Research project 2004-2007
* 2007-2008 - open source project
* some google sponsoring

Getting Production ready
==========================

* we worked a lot on running
  existing applications on top of PyPy

* sometimes requiring to change applications slightly

* especially refcounting details tend to be a problem

::

  open('xxx', 'w').write('stuff')

CTypes
======

* official way to have bindings to 
  external (C) libraries for PyPy

* can handle i.e. pysqlite-ctypes, pyglet, pymunk or Sole Scion,
  almost whatever....

* contribution to original ctypes
  (better errno handling, bugfixes, tests...)

* part of google sponsoring

* note: 32bit and a bit slow

CTypes configure
================

* our own small addition to general
  CTypes usefulness

* invokes C compiler for small details

* can handle #defines, types, structure layout
  etc.

Sqlite
======

* part of cpython stdlib since 2.5

* we use Gerhard Haering's CTypes version

* works reasonably well after some fixes

Django
======

* we run unmodified Django 1.0

* only sqlite DB backend for now

http://www.djangoproject.com

http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoAndPyPy

Pylons
======

* worked almost out of the box once eggs
  were working (1 day)

* no SQLAlchemy yet, obscure problems
  ahead

* unmodified passes all tests

* http://pylonshq.com/

Twisted & Nevow
===============

* twisted works (60/4500 tests failing)

* nevow works

* we don't support PyCrypto nor PyOpenSSL and we
  won't anytime soon (if nobody contributes CTypes or rpython
  versions)

* http://twistedmatrix.com/


Other software
==============

* pure python should just work 

* BitTorrent

* PyPy translation toolchain

* py lib 

* sympy

* various smaller things, templating engines

Obscure details that people rely on
===================================

* non-string keys in __dict__ of types

* exact naming of a list comprehension variable

* relying on untested and undocumented private stuff
  (zipimport._zip_directory_cache)

* exact message matching in exception catching
  code

* refcounting details

Transition to 2.5
==========================

* SOC project Bruno Gola 

* almost complete

* missing more testing, stdlib porting 

Conclusion on Compatibility
============================

* lessons learned: There is no feature obscure enough for people
  not to rely on it. 

* pypy-c interpreter probably the most compatible to CPython

* main blocker for running apps will be missing external modules

Speed - comparison with CPython
===============================

* we're something between 0.8-4x slower than
  CPython on various benchmarks.

* steady but slow progress

* we hope for our JIT to be a huge leap ahead

* pypy-c has fastest Interpreter startup

Speed - JIT generator
=====================

* not ready yet!

* will be super fast

* some prototypes, research ongoing

* psyco is a nice proof that this approach
  would work

Memory - comparison with CPython
===================================

* PyPy has pluggable Garbage Collection 

* gcbench - 0.8 (because of our faster GCs)

* better handling of unusual patterns

* care needed with communication with C

* GCs are semi-decent


Threading / Stackless
===================================

* currently using GIL, quite robust 

* free threading? "it's work" 

* pypy-c has software threading / stackless

* added during translation

Other backends
==============

* PyPy-jvm runs!

* more integration between pypy-cli and .NET

* general speed improvements

* both backends are progressing - very slowly though

* contributors wanted!

Sandboxing
==========

* fully sandboxed python interpreter

* all external calls to C goes via another
  python process

* special library for making custom
  policies

pypy-c on small devices
===============================

- cross-compilation 
- startup time 
- security 
- RAM usage 
- share interpreter state across processes
- pypy approach a very good fit! 

1.1 release goals 
===================================

- compatible to Python 2.5.2 
- well tested on win/linux 32 bit 
- running major packages unmodified 
- easy_install/distutils working 
- help e.g. by writing ctypes modules
