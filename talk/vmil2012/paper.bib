        abstract = {Trace-based compilation is a technique used in managed language runtimes to detect and compile frequently executed program paths. The goal is to reduce compilation time and improve code quality by only considering "hot" parts of methods for compilation. Trace compilation is well suited for interpreter-based execution environments because the control flow of an application program is highly visible and recordable. In this paper, we show that trace compilation is also feasible and beneficial in runtime environments without interpreters where it is more difficult to monitor the control flow of an application.},
