	abstract = {The Smalltalk-80* programming language includes dynamic storage allocation, full upward funargs, and universally polymorphic procedures; the Smalltalk-80 programming system features interactive execution with incremental compilation, and implementation portability. These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually. A new implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete (object code) compatibility with existing implementations. This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages. The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.},

	abstract = {Intense research on virtual machines has highlighted the need for flexible software architectures that allow quick evaluation of new design and implementation techniques. The interface between the compiler and runtime system is a principal factor in the flexibility of both components and is critical to enabling rapid pursuit of new optimizations and features. Although many virtual machines have demonstrated modularity for many components, significant dependencies often remain between the compiler and the runtime system components such as the object model and memory management system. This paper addresses this challenge with a carefully designed strict compiler-runtime interface and the {XIR} language. Instead of the compiler backend lowering object operations to machine operations using hard-wired runtime-specific logic, {XIR} allows the runtime system to implement this logic, simultaneously simplifying and separating the backend from runtime-system details. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of this compiler-runtime interface and the {XIR} language in the {C1X} dynamic compiler, a port of the {HotSpotTM} Client compiler. Our results show a significant reduction in backend complexity with {XIR} and an overall reduction in the compiler-runtime interface complexity while still generating comparable quality code with only minor impact on compilation time.},

This makes efficient static program compilation difficult, as well as limiting the amount of early error detection that can be performed.

One may question why programmers are drawn to these languages at all, if only to use them in a static-friendly style. In this paper we present our results after measuring the dynamic behaviour of 24 production-stage open source Python programs. The programs tested included arcade games, {GUI} applications and non-interactive batch programs.

We present a high-level continuation-based Prolog interpreter based on the {PyPy} project. The {PyPy} project makes it possible to easily and efficiently implement dynamic languages. It provides tools that automatically generate a just-in-time compiler for a given interpreter of the target language, by using partial evaluation techniques. The resulting Prolog implementation is surprisingly efficient: it clearly outperforms existing interpreters of Prolog in high-level languages such as Java. Moreover, on some benchmarks, our system outperforms state-of-the-art {WAM-based} Prolog implementations. Our paper aims to show that declarative languages such as Prolog can indeed benefit from having a just-in-time compiler and that {PyPy} can form the basis for implementing programming languages other than Python.},

Knowing which objects do not escape allows a compiler to perform aggressive {optimizations.This} paper presents a new intraprocedural and interprocedural algorithm for escape analysis in the context of dynamic compilation where the compiler has to cope with dynamic class loading and deoptimization. It was implemented for Sun Microsystems' Java {HotSpot™} client compiler and operates on an intermediate representation in {SSA} form. We introduce equi-escape sets for the efficient propagation of escape information between related objects. The analysis is used for scalar replacement of fields and synchronization removal, as well as for stack allocation of objects and fixed-sized arrays. The results of the interprocedural analysis support the compiler in inlining decisions and allow actual parameters to be allocated on the caller {stack.Under} certain circumstances, the Java {HotSpot™} {VM} is forced to stop executing a method's machine code and transfer control to the interpreter. This is called deoptimization. Since the interpreter does not know about the scalar replacement and synchronization removal performed by the compiler, the deoptimization framework was extended to reallocate and relock objects on demand.},

This reduces the execution speed of Java programs. Array bounds check elimination identifies situations in which such checks are redundant and can be removed. We present an array bounds check elimination algorithm for the Java {HotSpot(TM)} {VM} based on static analysis in the just-in-time compiler. The algorithm works on an intermediate representation in static single assignment form and maintains conditions for index expressions. It fully removes bounds checks if it can be proven that they never fail. Whenever possible, it moves bounds checks out of loops. The static number of checks remains the same, but a check inside a loop is likely to be executed more often. If such a check fails, the executing program falls back to interpreted mode, avoiding the problem that an exception is thrown at the wrong place. The evaluation shows a speedup near to the theoretical maximum for the scientific {SciMark} benchmark suite and also significant improvements for some Java Grande benchmarks. The algorithm slightly increases the execution speed for the {SPECjvm98} benchmark suite. The evaluation of the {DaCapo} benchmarks shows that array bounds checks do not have a significant impact on the performance of object-oriented applications.},

Deoptimization requires the compiler to supply debugging information at discrete interrupt points; the compiler can still perform extensive optimizations between interrupt points without affecting debuggability. At the same time, the inability to interrupt between interrupt points is invisible to the user. Our debugging system also handles programming changes during debugging. Again, the system provides expected behavior: it is possible to change a running program and immediately observe the effects of the change. Dynamic deoptimization transforms old compiled code (which may contain inlined copies of the old version of the changed procedure) into new versions reflecting the current source-level state.

	abstract = {The {JavaTM} programming language does not allow the programmer to influence memory management. An object is usually allocated on the heap and deallocated by the garbage collector when it is not referenced any longer. Under certain conditions, the virtual machine can allocate objects on the stack or eliminate their allocation via scalar replacement. However, even if the dynamic compiler guarantees that the conditions are fulfilled, the optimizations require support by the run-time environment. We implemented a new escape analysis algorithm for Sun Microsystems' Java {HotSpotTM} {VM.} The results are used to replace objects with scalar variables, to allocate objects on the stack, and to remove synchronization. This paper deals with the representation of optimized objects in the debugging information and with reallocation and garbage collection support for a safe execution of optimized methods. Assignments to fields of parameters that can refer to both stack and heap objects are associated with an extended write barrier which skips card marking for stack objects. The traversal of objects during garbage collection uses a wrapper that abstracts from stack objects and presents their pointer fields as root pointers to the garbage collector. When a previously compiled and currently executing method must be continued in the interpreter because dynamic class loading invalidates the machine code, execution is suspended and compiler optimizations are undone. Scalar-replaced objects are reallocated on the heap lazily when control returns to the invalidated method, whereas stack-allocated objects must be reallocated immediately before program execution resumes. After reallocation, objects for which synchronization was removed are relocked.},

	abstract = {Programming systems should be both responsive (to support rapid development) and efficient (to complete computations quickly). Pure object-oriented languages are harder to implement efficiently since they need optimization to achieve good performance. Unfortunately, optimization conflicts with interactive responsiveness because it tends to produce long compilation pauses, leading to unresponsive programming environments. Therefore, to achieve good responsiveness, existing exploratory programming environments such as the Smalltalk-80 environment rely on interpretation or non-optimizing dynamic compilation. But such systems pay a price for their interactiveness, since they may execute programs several times slower than an optimizing {system.SELF-93} reconciles high performance with responsiveness by combining a fast, non-optimizing compiler with a slower, optimizing compiler. The resulting system achieves both excellent performance (two or three times faster than existing Smalltalk systems) and good responsiveness. Except for situations requiring large applications to be (re)compiled from scratch, the system allows for pleasant interactive use with few perceptible compilation pauses. To our knowledge, {SELF-93} is the first implementation of a pure object-oriented language achieving both good performance and good {responsiveness.When} measuring interactive pauses, it is imperative to treat multiple short pauses as one longer pause if the pauses occur in short succession, since they are perceived as one pause by the user. We propose a definition of pause clustering and show that clustering can make an order-of-magnitude difference in the pause time distribution.},
