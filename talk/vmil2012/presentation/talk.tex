% XXX todos:
% note that two fields is a simplification
% have a diagram for the example trace
% lifting can never produce new operations
% have some sort of overview or position indicator for the many graphical slides, too easy to get lost
% more details about benchmarks, diagram?


% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

  \frametitle{Tracing JITs Compile by Observing an Interpreter}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item VM contains both an interpreter and the tracing JIT compiler
      \item JIT works by observing and logging what the interpreter does
      \begin{itemize}
          \item for interesting, commonly executed code paths
          \item produces a linear list of operations (trace)
      \end{itemize}
      \item trace is optimized and then turned into machine code
  \end{itemize}
