Abstract (max 250 letters): 

Some three years and two CCC talks later, we'd like to present 
a variety of results and features of the PyPy project.  Topics will 
include lightweight threading, low-level and high level backends, 
e type-inferencing extension compiler, lazy evaluation and 
applications of the PyPy translation toolchain, writing custom 
Garbage Collectors

Description (250-500 words): 

PyPy is a reimplementation of Python written in a restricted subset of
Python itself, flexible and easy to experiment with. Due to its flexibility
it is easy to add language features that are sometimes hard to implement in
more traditional VM implementations. We have implemented a number of such
features, some of them enhancing the expressiveness and flexibility
of the language. In addition there are some interesting applications of the
translation toolchain that go beyond its original design goal of translating
the Python interpreter to low-level languages.

One of the language features the talk will showcase is the use of  
OS-independent microthreads. With PyPy we can run millions
of microthreads, their number limited only by memory.  The scheduling 
of these threads can be done in various ways.  One of them is to 
use Oz-like (and Prolog-like) dataflow variables for 
synchronization. Another one is to explicitly state which 
threadlet is supposed to run.

Another interesting feature which is not common in other object oriented
languages is transparent lazy evaluation of functions. 

The translation toolchain has a variety of targets which Restricted Python
code can be translated to: C, LLVM, CLI/.NET, Javascript (and more to come).
The Javascript backend can be used to implement AJAX application in Python
and run them either in Python (for testing purposes) or translate them to
Javascript and run them in the browser.

We also intend to present some just-in-time efforts. 

Oh, and development of PyPy is actually partly funded by the 
European Union during the 6th Research Framework programme.
