Py3k status update #6
---------------------

This is the sixth status update about our work on the `py3k branch`_, which we
can work on thanks to all of the people who donated_ to the `py3k proposal`_.

The coolest news is not about what we did in the past weeks, but what we will
do in the next: I am pleased to announce that Philip Jenvey has been selected
to be funded for his upcoming work on py3k, thanks to your generous
donations. He will start to work on it shortly, and he will surely help the
branch to make faster progress.  I am also particularly happy of this because
Philip is the first non-core developer who is getting paid with donations: he
demonstrated over the past months to be able to work effectively on PyPy, and
so we were happy to approve his application for the job.  This means that
everyone can be potentially selected in the future, the only strict
requirement is prove to be able to work on PyPy by contributing to the
project.

Back to the status of the branch. Most of the work since the last status
update has been done in the area of, guess what?, unicode strings. As usual,
this is one of the most important changes between Python 2 and Python 3, so
it's not surprising.  The biggest news is that now PyPy internally supports
unicode identifiers (such as names of variables, functions, attributes, etc.),
whereas earlier it supported only ASCII bytes strings.  The changes is still
barely visible from the outside, because the parser still rejects non-ASCII
identifiers, however you can see it with a bit of creativity::

    >>>> def foo(x): pass
    >>>> foo(**{'àèìòù': 42})      
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: foo() got an unexpected keyword argument 'àèìòù'

Before the latest changes, you used to get question marks instead of the
proper name for the keyword argument.  Although this might seem like a small
detail, it is a big step towards a proper working Python 3 interpreter and it
required a couple of days of headaches.  A spin-off of this work is that now
RPython has better built-in support for unicode (also in the default branch):
for example, it now supports unicode string formatting (using the percent
operator) and the methods ``.encode/.decode('utf-8')``.

Other than that there is the usual list of smaller issues and bugs that got
fixed, such as: teach the compiler when to emit the new opcode
``DELETE_DEREF`` (and implement it!); detect when we use spaces and TABs
inconsistently in the source code, as CPython does; fix yet another bug
related to the new lexically scoped exceptions (this is the last one,
hopefully); port some of the changes that we did to the standard CPython 2.7
tests to 3.2, to mark those which are implementation details and should not be
run on PyPy.

Finally, I would like to thanks Amaury and Ariel Ben-Yehuda for his work on
the branch; among other things, Amaury recently worked on ``cpyext`` and on
the PyPy ``_cffi_backend``, while Ariel submitted a patch to implement `PEP
3138`.
