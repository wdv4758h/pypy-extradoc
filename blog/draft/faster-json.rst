Speeding up JSON encoding in PyPy
=================================

Hi

Recently I spent a bit of effort into speeding up JSON in PyPy. I started with
writing a `benchmark`_, which is admittedly not a very good one, but it's
better than nothing (suggestions on how to improve it are welcome!). XXX:
explain in one line what the benchmark does?

For this particular benchmark, the numbers are as follow. **Note that CPython by
default uses the optimized C extension, while PyPy uses the pure Python one**.
PyPy trunk contains another pure Python version which has been optimized
specifically for the PyPy JIT. Detailed optimizations are described later in
this post.

The number reported is the time taken for the third run, when things are
warmed up. Full session `here`_.

+----------------------------+-------------+
| CPython 2.6                | 22s         |
+----------------------------+-------------+
| CPython 2.7                | **3.7s**    |
+----------------------------+-------------+
| CPython 2.7 no C extension | 44s         |
+----------------------------+-------------+
| PyPy 1.5                   | 34s         |
+----------------------------+-------------+
| PyPy 1.6                   | 22s         |
+----------------------------+-------------+
| PyPy trunk                 | **3.3s**    |

Lessons learned:

Expectations are high
---------------------

A lot of performance critical stuff in Python world is already written in a hand
optimized C. Writing C (especially when you interface with CPython C API) is
ugly and takes significant effort. This approach does not scale well when
there is a lot of code to be written or when there is a very tight coupling
between the part to be rewritten and the rest of the code. Still, people would
expect PyPy to be better at "tasks" and not precisely at running equivalent
code, hence a comparison between the C extension and the pure python version
is sound. Fortunately it's possible to outperform the C extension, but requires
a bit of effort on the programmer side as well.

Often interface between the C and Python part is ugly
-----------------------------------------------------

This is very clear if you look at json module as implemented in CPython's
standard library. Not everything is in C (it would probably be just too
much effort) and the interface to what is in C is guided via profiling not
via what kind of interface makes sense. It's clear from CPython 2.6 to 2.7.
Just adapting the code to interface with C made the Python version slower.
Removing this clutter improves the readability a lot and improves PyPy's version
a bit, although I don't have hard numbers.

JitViewer is crucial
--------------------

In case you're fighting with PyPy's performance, `jitviewer`_ is worth a shot.
While it's not completely trivial to understand what's going on, it'll
definitely show you what kind of loops got compiled and how.

No nice and fast way to build strings in Python
-----------------------------------------------

PyPy has a custom thing called ``__pypy__.builders.StringBuilder``. It has
a few a features that make it much easier to optimize than other ways like
``str.join()`` or ``cStringIO``.

* You can specify the start size, which helps a lot if you can even provide
  a rough estimate on the size of the string (less copying)
* Only append and build are allowed. While  the string is being built you
  can't seek or do anything else. After it's built you can never append any more.
* Unicode version available as well as ``__pypy__.builders.UnicodeBuilder``.

Method calls are ok, immutable globals are ok
---------------------------------------------

PyPy's JIT seems to be good enough for at least the simple cases. Calling
methods for common infrastructure or loading globals (instead of rebinding as
locals) is fast enough and improves code readability.

I must admit I worked around PyPy's performance bug
---------------------------------------------------

For obscure (although eventually fixable) reasons, this::

  for c in s: # s is string
    del c

is faster than::

  for c in s:
    pass

This is a PyPy performance bug and should be fixed, but on different branch ;-)

PyPy's JIT is good
--------------------------

I was pretty surprised, but the JIT actually did make stuff work nicely.
It is possible to write code in Python and make it run fast, but you have
to be a bit careful. Again, jitviewer is your friend.
