Incremental Garbage Collector in PyPy
=====================================

Hello everyone.

We're pleased to announce that as of today (so tomorrows nightly),
the default PyPy comes with a GC that has much smaller pauses than yesterday.

Let's start with explaining roughly what GC pauses are. In CPython each
object has a reference count, which is incremented each time we create
references and decremented each time we forget them. This means that objects
are freed each time they become unreachable. That is only half of the story
though. Consider code like this::

   class A(object):
        pass

   a = A()
   b = A()
   a.item = b
   b.item = a
   del a
   del b

This creates a reference cycles. It means that while we deleted references to
``a`` and ``b`` from the current scope, they still have a refcount of 1,
because they point to each other, while the whole group has no reference
from the outside. CPython employs a cyclic garbage collector that is used to
find such cycles. It walks all objects in memory, starting from known roots
like immortal prebuilt objects, roots on the stack etc. This solves the
problem, but creates a noticable GC pauses when the heap becomes large and
convoluted.

PyPy has essentially only the cycle finder - it does not bother with reference
counting, but it walks alive objects every now and then (this is a big
simplification, PyPy's GC is much more complex than this). It also has
a problem of GC pauses. To alleviate this problem, which is essential for
applications like games, we started to work on incremental GC, which spreads
the walking of objects and cleaning them across the execution time in smaller
intervals. The work was sponsored by the Raspberry Pi foundation, started
by Andrew Chambers and finished by Armin Rigo and Maciej Fija≈Çkowski.
