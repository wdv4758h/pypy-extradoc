A thank you to the PSF
======================

This year's PyCon was an incredible time, several members of the PyPy team were
there, and we'll be blogging more about our experienced in the coming days,
however for now we wanted to extend a thank you to the `Python Software
Foundation (PSF) <http://www.python.org/psf/>`_.

As you may have heard, on Friday morning at PyCon Jesse Noller handed the PyPy
team a check for $10,000, on behalf of the PSF.  This was in recognition of our
success in the past few years bringing PyPy from a research project to a fast,
compliant, production ready Python implementation, and to allow us to continue
our work on making it faster and more up to date with upstream version changes.

Beyond the large check, we're grateful for the endoresement this represents,
both of our work on PyPy, as well as all alternatve Python VMs.  The PSF is
shifting its focus from representing just CPython to all of the Python
implementation, which we are very appreciative of.
