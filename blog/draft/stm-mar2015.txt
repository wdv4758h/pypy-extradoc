PyPy-STM 2.5.1 - Mawhrin-Skel
=============================

We're pleased to announce PyPy-STM 2.5.1, codenamed Mawhrin-Skel.
This is the second official release of PyPy-STM.  You can download
this release here (64-bit Linux only):

PyPy is an implementation of the Python programming language which focuses
on performance. So far we've been relentlessly optimizing for the single
core/process scenario. PyPy STM brings to the table a version of PyPy
that does not have the infamous Global Interpreter Lock, hence can run
multiple threads on multiple cores. Additionally it comes with a set
of primitives that make writing multithreaded applications a lot easier,
as explained below (see TransactionQueue) and in the documentation.

Internally, PyPy-STM is based on the Software Transactional Memory
plug-in called stmgc-c7.  This version comes with a relatively
reasonable single-core overhead but scales only up to around 4 cores
on some examples; the next version of the plug-in, stmgc-c8, is in
development and should address that limitation (as well as reduce the
overhead).  These versions only support 64-bit Linux; we'd welcome
someone to port the upcoming stmgc-c8 to other (64-bit) platforms.

This release passes all regular PyPy tests, except for a few
special cases.  In other words, you should be able to drop in
PyPy-STM instead of the regular PyPy and your program should still
work.  See `current status`_ for more information.

This work was done by Remi Meier and Armin Rigo.  Thanks to all donors
for `crowd-funding the STM work`_ so far!  As usual, it took longer
than we would have thought.  I really want to thank the people that
kept making donations anyway.  Your trust is greatly appreciated!

What's new?
-----------

Compared to the `July 2014 release`_, the main addition is a way to
get reports about STM conflicts.  This is an essential new feature.

To understand why this is so important, consider that if you already
played around with the previous release, chances are that you didn't
get very far.  It probably felt like a toy: on very small examples it
would nicely scale, but on any larger example it would not scale at
all.  You didn't get any feedback about why, but the underlying reason
is that, in a typical large example, there are some STM conflicts that
occur all the time and that won't be immediately found just by
thinking.  This prevents any parallelization.

Now PyPy-STM is no longer a black box: you have a way to learn about
these conflicts, fix them, and try again.  The tl;dr version is to run::

    PYPYSTM=stmlog ./pypy-stm yourprogr.py
    ./print_stm_log.py stmlog

More details in `the STM user guide`_.


Performance
-----------

The performance is now more stable than it used to be.  More
precisely, the best case is still "25%-40% single-core slow-down with
very good scaling up to 4 threads", but the average performance seems
not too far from that.  There are still dark spots --- notably, the
JIT is still slower to warm up, though it was improved a lot.  These
are documented in the `current status`_ section.  Apart from
that, we should not get more than 2x single-core slow-down in the
worst case.  Please report such cases as bugs!


TransactionQueue
----------------

As explained before, PyPy-STM is more than "just" a Python without
GIL.  It is a Python in which you can do minor tweaks to your
existing, *non-multithreaded* programs and get them to use multiple
cores.  You identify medium- or large-sized, likely-independent parts
of the code and to ask PyPy-STM to run these parts in parallel.  An
example would be every iteration of some outermost loop over all items
of a dictionary.  This is done with a new API:
``transaction.TransactionQueue()``.  See ``help(TransactionQueue)`` or
read more about it in `the STM user guide`_.

This is not a 100% mechanical change: very likely, you need to hunt
for and fix "STM conflicts" that prevent parallel execution (see
docs_).  However, at all points your program runs correctly, and you
can stop the hunt when you get acceptable performance.  You don't get
deadlocks or corrupted state.
