Hello everyone.

I would like to inform everyone that there is a very interesting opportunity
for doing an internship at `NCAR`_ in the lovely town of `Boulder`_, situated
on the foothils of Rocky Mountains. Before you read on, make sure you are:

* A student of a US University, who is legally eglibale to work in the US.

* At least finishing second year this year.

* Apply before February 3rd.

The internship itself is to focus on using PyPy (in some way) to provide
a high performance numeric kernel for an atmospheric model and measuring how
fast we can go. This is very well in line with what the current effort on
NumPy in PyPy is about. The internship will be mentored by `Davide del Vento`_
and I hope to have some influence over where it goes myself :-)

Few interesting links:

* `program website`_

* `internship proposal`_ - note that the actual roadmap is very flexible, as
  long as it's numeric kernel of an atmospheric model using PyPy.

Fell free to contact Davide for details about the proposal and `pypy-dev`_ or
me directly for details about pypy
