PyPy Usage Survey
=================

We've been working on PyPy for a long time. But readers of this blog will now
that in the past year something has changed: we think PyPy is production ready.
And it's not just us, this week `LWN.net`_ wrote an article about how `PyPy
sped up one of their scripts by a factor of three`_, noting that, "plans are to
run gitdm under PyPy from here on out". All in all we think PyPy is pretty
great, but not everyone is using it yet, and we want to know why. We want your
feedback on why PyPy isn't ready to be your only Python yet, and how we can
improve it to make that happen.

Therefore, we've put together a quick suvey, whether you're using PyPy or not
if you could take a few minutes to fill it out and let us know how we're doing
we'd really appreciate it. You can find the form `here`_.

Thanks,
The PyPy team
