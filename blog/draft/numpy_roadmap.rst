Numpy in PyPy - status and roadmap
==================================

Hello.


NumPy integration is one of the single most requested features for PyPy. This
post tries to describe where we are, what we plan (or what we don't plan), and
how you can help.

**The short version for impatient: there are experiments being done, which are
already faster and better than numpy, and there is a path forward, but there is
a definite lack of dedicated people or money to tackle that.**

The longer version
------------------

The NumPy effort in PyPy has, for the past two years, been my on-and-off-again
project. There were `some experiments`_ then mostly nothing and then some more
experiments that are documented below.

The general idea that seems to be worth pursuing would be to implement NumPy in
RPython (the implementation language of PyPy) and then leverage the JIT to achieve
extra speedups. The really cool thing about this part is that overall JIT
improvements will benefit NumPy performance out of the box, without extra
tweaking. As of now there is branch called `numpy-exp`_ which contains a
translatable version of a very minimal version of numpy in the module called
``micronumpy``. `Example benchmarks`_ show the following:

+--------------------------------+---------------+-------------+
|                                | add           | iterate     |
+--------------------------------+---------------+-------------+
| CPython 2.6.5 with numpy 1.3.0 | 0.260s (1x)   | 4.2 (1x)    |
+--------------------------------+---------------+-------------+
| PyPy numpy-exp @ 3a9d77b789e1  | 0.120s (2.2x) | 0.087 (48x) |
+--------------------------------+---------------+-------------+

As you can see, the moment floats cross the numpy-python boundary, PyPy's JIT
goes blazingly fast, but even running array addition is faster by a fair degree
(although numexpr is still faster, we're working on it).

The exact way how array addition is implemented is worth another blog post, but
in short it lazily evaluates the expression forcing it at the end and avoiding
intermediate results. This way scales much better than numexpr and can lead to
speeding up all the operations that you can perform on matrices.

The next obvious step would be to extend the JIT to use SSE operations on x86
CPUs, which should speed it up by about additional 2x.

Overall it seems pretty obvious that reimplementing NumPy in PyPy (in RPython)
can bring most of the useful compatibility within a month-two-three of work.
It also seems that the result will be faster for most cases and the same speed
as original numpy for other cases. The only problem is finding the dedicated
persons willing to spend quite some time on this and however, I am willing to
both mentor such a person and encourage him or her.

Another option would be to sponsor NumPy development. In case you're
interested, please get in touch with us or leave your email in comments.
