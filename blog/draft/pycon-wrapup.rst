PyCon 2012
==========

So, PyCon happened. This was the biggest PyCon ever and probably the biggest
gathering of Python hackers ever.

From the PyPy perspective, a lot at PyCon was about PyPy. Listing things:

* David Beazley presented an excellent keynote describing his experience
  diving head-first into PyPy and at least partly failing. He, however, did
  not fail to explain bits and pieces about PyPy's architecture.
  `Video`_ is available.

* We gave tons of talks, including the `tutorial`_, `why pypy by example`_
  and `pypy's JIT architecture`_

* We had a giant influx of new commiters, easily doubling the amount of pull
  requests ever created for PyPy. The main topics for newcomers were numpy and
  py3k, disproving what David said about PyPy being too hard to dive into ;)

* Guido argued in his keynote that Python is not too slow. In the meantime,
  we're trying to `prove him correct`_ :-)

We would like to thank everyone who talked to us, shared ideas and especially
those who participated in sprints - we're always happy to welcome newcomers!

I'm sure there is tons of things I forgot, but thank you all!

Cheers,
fijal
