PyCon 2012
==========

So, PyCon happened. This was the biggest PyCon ever and probably the biggest
gathering of Python hackers ever.

From the PyPy perspective, a lot at PyCon was about PyPy. Listing things:

* David Beazley did an excellent keynote on trying to dive head-first into
  PyPy and at least partly failing. He however did not fail to explain
  bits and pieces about PyPy's architecture. `Video`_ is available.

* We gave tons of talks, including the `tutorial`_ and `why pypy by example`_.

* We had a giant influx of new commiters, easily doubling the amount of pull
  requests ever created for PyPy. The main topics for newcomers were numpy and
  py3k, disproving what David said about PyPy being too hard to dive into ;)

* Guido argued in his keynote that Python is not too slow. In the meantime,
  we're trying to `prove him correct`_ :-)
