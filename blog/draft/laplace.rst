NumPyPy progress report - running benchmarks
============================================

Hello.

We're excited to let you know about some of the great progress we've made on
NumPyPy -- both completeness and performance. Here we'll mostly talk about the
performance side and how far we have come so far. **Word of warning:** this
work isn't done - we're maybe half way to where we want to be and there are
many trivial and not so trivial optimizations to be written. (For example, we
haven't even started to implement important optimizations, like vectorization.)

Benchmark
---------

We chose a laplace transform, based on SciPy's `PerformancePython`_ wiki.
Unfortunately, the different implementations on the wiki page accidentally use
two different algorithms, which have different convergences, and very different
performance characteristics on modern computers. As a result, we implemented
our own versions in both C and Python (with and without NumPy). The full source
can be found in `fijal's hack`_ repo, all these benchmarks were performed at
revision 18502dbbcdb3.

First, let me describe various algorithms used. Note that some of them contain
PyPy-specific hacks to work around limitations in the current implementation.
These hacks will go away eventually and the performance will improve.
Numerically the algorithms used are identical, however exact data layout in
memory differs between them.

**A note about all the benchmarks:** they were each run once, but the
performance is very stable across runs.

Starting with the C version, it implements a dead simple laplace transform
using two loops and double-reference memory (array of ``int*``). The double
reference does not matter for performance and the two algorithms are
implemented in ``inline-laplace.c`` and ``laplace.c``. They were both compiled
with ``gcc 4.4.5`` at ``-O3``.

A straightforward version of those in Python is implemented in ``laplace.py``
using respectively ``inline_slow_time_step`` and ``slow_time_step``.
``slow_2_time_step`` does the same thing, except it copies arrays in-place
instead of creating new copies.

+-----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+

An important thing to notice here is that the data dependency in the inline
version causes a huge slowdown for the C versions. This is already not too bad
for us though, the braindead Python version takes longer and PyPy is not able
to take advantage of the knowledge that the data is independent, but it is in
the same ballpark as the C versions - **15% - 170%** slower, but the algorithm
you choose matters more than the language. By comparison, the slow versions
take about **5.75s** each on CPython 2.6 per iteration, and by estimating,
are about **200x** slower than the PyPy equivalent, if I had the patience to
measure the full run.

The next step is to use NumPy expressions. The first problem we run into is
that computing the error requires walking the entire array a second time. This
is fairly inefficient in terms of cache access, so I took the liberty of
computing the errors every 15 steps. This results in the convergence being
rounded to the nearest 15 iterations, but speeds things up considerably.
``numeric_time_step`` takes the most braindead approach of replacing the array
with itself, like this::

  u[1:-1, 1:-1] = ((u[0:-2, 1:-1] + u[2:, 1:-1])*dy2 +
                         (u[1:-1,0:-2] + u[1:-1, 2:])*dx2)*dnr_inv

We need 3 arrays here - one is an intermediate (PyPy only needs one, for all of
those subexpressions), one is a copy for computing the error, and one is the
result. This works automatically, since in NumPy ``+`` or ``*`` creates an
intermediate, while NumPyPy avoids allocating the intermediate if possible.

``numeric_2_time_step`` works in pretty much the same way::

  src = self.u
  self.u = src.copy()
  self.u[1:-1, 1:-1] = ((src[0:-2, 1:-1] + src[2:, 1:-1])*dy2 +
                        (src[1:-1,0:-2] + src[1:-1, 2:])*dx2)*dnr_inv

except the copy is now explicit rather than implicit.

``numeric_3_time_step`` does the same thing, but notices you don't have to copy
the entire array, it's enough to copy the border pieces and fill rest with
zeros::

        src = self.u
        self.u = numpy.zeros((self.nx, self.ny), 'd')
        self.u[0] = src[0]
        self.u[-1] = src[-1]
        self.u[:, 0] = src[:, 0]
        self.u[:, -1] = src[:, -1]
        self.u[1:-1, 1:-1] = ((src[0:-2, 1:-1] + src[2:, 1:-1])*dy2 +
                              (src[1:-1,0:-2] + src[1:-1, 2:])*dx2)*dnr_inv

``numeric_4_time_step`` is the one that tries hardest to resemble the C version.
Instead of doing an array copy, it actually notices that you can alternate
between two arrays. This is exactly what the C version does. The
``remove_invalidates`` call is a PyPy specific hack - we hope to remove this
call in the near future, but in short it promises "I don't have any unbuilt
intermediates that depend on the value of the argument", which means you don't
have to compute sub-expressions you're not actually using::

        remove_invalidates(self.old_u)
        remove_invalidates(self.u)
        self.old_u[:,:] = self.u
        src = self.old_u
        self.u[1:-1, 1:-1] = ((src[0:-2, 1:-1] + src[2:, 1:-1])*dy2 +
                              (src[1:-1,0:-2] + src[1:-1, 2:])*dx2)*dnr_inv

This one is the most comparable to the C version.

``numeric_5_time_step`` does the same thing, but notices you don't have to copy
the entire array, it's enough to just copy the edges. This is an optimization
that was not done in the C version::

        remove_invalidates(self.old_u)
        remove_invalidates(self.u)
        src = self.u
        self.old_u, self.u = self.u, self.old_u
        self.u[0] = src[0]
        self.u[-1] = src[-1]
        self.u[:, 0] = src[:, 0]
        self.u[:, -1] = src[:, -1]
        self.u[1:-1, 1:-1] = ((src[0:-2, 1:-1] + src[2:, 1:-1])*dy2 +
                              (src[1:-1,0:-2] + src[1:-1, 2:])*dx2)*dnr_inv

Let's look at the table of runs. As before, ``gcc 4.4.5``, compiled at ``-O3``,
and PyPy nightly 7bb8b38d8563, on an x86-64 machine. All of the numeric methods
run for 226 steps, slightly more than the 219, rounding to the next 15 when the
error is computed.

We think that these preliminary results are pretty good, they're not as fast as
the C version (or as fast as we'd like them to be), but we're already much
faster than NumPy on CPython, almost always by more than 2x on this relatively
real-world example. This is not the end though, in fact it's hardly the
beginning: as we continue work, we hope to make even much better use of the
high level information that we have. Looking at the generated assembler by
gcc in this example it's pretty clear we can outperform it by having a much
better aliasing information and hence a better possibilities for vectorization.

Cheers,
fijal
