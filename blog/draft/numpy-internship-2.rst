Hello everyone

I would like to advertise a PyPy-related summer internship at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in lovely
Boulder, Colorado. As for the last year, the mentor will be Davide del Vento,
with my possible support on the PyPy side.

The full details of the application are to be found on
`the internship description`_ and make sure you read `the requirements`_
first. Important requirements:

* Must currently be enrolled in a United States university.

* Only students authorized to work for any employer in the United
  States will be considered for the SIParCS program.

* Must be a graduate or under graduate who has completed their sophomore year.

If you happen to fulfill the requirements, to me this sounds like
a great opportunity to spend a summer at NCAR in Boulder hacking on atmospheric
models using PyPy.
