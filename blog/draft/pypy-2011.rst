PyPy development in 2011
========================

Hello everyone.

PyPy development is fast, sometimes very fast. We try to do 3-4 releases a year
and yet a lot of time when someone complains about the last release being slow
we usually say "oh, but it's the release, that was AGES ago". That makes
something as big as summarizing a year next to impossible, but using my
external IQ amplifiers like internet and hg log, I will try to provide you
with some semi-serious statistics:

* We made 3 releases last year, boringly, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7

* Number of visitors on pypy.org grew from about 200 to 800 per day (averaged
  weekly)

* We spoke at 15 conferences/meetups

* We made 10660 commits, or 29 per day (mostly typos ;-)

* We published 43 blog posts, keeping you entertained almost weekly

* We made PyPy over 2x faster (on a select set of benchmarks),
