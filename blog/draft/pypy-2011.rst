PyPy development in 2011
========================

Hello everyone.

PyPy's development is fast, sometimes very fast. We try to do 3-4 releases a
year and still many times when someone complains about the latest release being
slow we usually say "oh, that release was AGES ago". This makes something as
big as summarizing a year next to impossible, but using my external IQ
amplifiers, like internet and hg log, I will try to provide you with some
semi-serious statistics:

* We did 3 releases last year, boringly named, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7

* The number of visitors on pypy.org grew from about 200 to 800 per day
  (averaged weekly)

* We spoke at 15 conferences/meetups
  (XXX: can we put a list in a comment to be sure it's correct)

* We made 10660 commits, or 29 per day (mostly typos ;-))

* We published 43 blog posts, keeping you entertained almost weekly

* We made PyPy over 2x faster (on a select set of benchmarks), see the
  `1.4 and nightly`_ comparison

* 71 brand new people contributed at least one commit to the PyPy repository.
  (XXX: this is what I got by doing wc on contributors.txt at 2011-01-01 and
  the current contributors.rst, but we still need to update the latter)

* We made PyPy 17x more compatible (of course this is not measurable, so we're
  going to claim it!)

* We have [XXX insert unicode for infinity] infinitely many times more users
  now, since no one used 1.4 in production

2011 was a very exciting year for us. But we're pretty sure 2012 is going to be
even more exciting! So watch this space for more exciting news, try PyPy out on
your projects, and, as always, we invite you to join us and contribute to PyPy
in any way you can.

Signed,
The PyPy Developers
