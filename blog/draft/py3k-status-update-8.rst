Py3k status update #8
---------------------

This is the eight status update about our work on the `py3k branch`_, which
we can work on thanks to all of the people who donated_ to the `py3k
proposal`_.

Just a short update on November's work: we're now passing about 194 of
approximately 355 modules of CPython's regression test suite, up from passing
160 last month. Many test modules only fail a small number of individual tests
now.

We'd like to thank Amaury Forgeot d'Arc for his contributions, in particular he
has made significant progress on updating `CPyExt`_ for Python 3 this month.

Some other highlights:

* ``test_marshal`` now passes, and there's been significant progress on
  pickling (thanks `Kenny Levinsen`_ and Amaury for implementing
  ``int.{to,from}_bytes``)

* We now have a ``_posixsubprocess`` module

* More encoding related fixes, which affects many failing tests

* ``_sre`` was updated and now ``test_re`` almost passes

* Exception behavior is almost complete per the Python 3 specs, what's mostly
  missing now are the new ``__context__`` and ``__traceback__`` attributes (`PEP
  3134`_)

* Fixed some crashes and deadlocks occurring during the regression tests

* We merged the `unicode-strategies`_ branch both to default and to py3k: now we
  have versions of lists, dictionaries and sets specialized for unicode
  elements, as we already had for strings.

* However, for string-specialized containers are still faster in some cases
  because there are shortcuts which have not been implemented for unicode yet
  (e.g., constructing a set of strings from a list of strings). The plan is to
  completely kill the shortcuts and improve the JIT to produce the fast
  version automatically for both the string and unicode versions, to have a
  more maintainable codebase without sacrificing the speed. The `autoreds`_
  branch (already merged) was a first step in this direction.

cheers,
Philip&Antonio
