September donations and thank you to the Python Software Foundation!
====================================================================

Hello everyone!

We would like to show you a short update on the PyPy funding.
We gathered a total of $15,986 in the month of September and as per
`earlier agreement`_, the Python Software Foundation donated $10,000
to PyPy. We would like to thank everyone participating and the PSF in
particular for supporting the PyPy project and making our work possible!

We've been working hard on the goals outlined in the funding proposals.

* `PyPy Python 3`_ support has been in beta for a while and it's already
  being used by many people, as seen per the number of reported bugs.
  We're currently supporting 3.2, planning on moving towards 3.4 in the
  future.

* Software Transactional Memory has been a successful research project,
  with `first real world`_ results shown during the Warsaw sprint.

* More detailed update on numpy will be published soon. A little spoiler is
  that we're planning on addressing matplotlib, scipy and the larger ecosystem
  to some extent. Stay tuned!

Again, thanks to everyone who donated and happy Thanksgiving to everyone
on that side of the world!

Cheers,
fijal
