Come see us at PyCon 2012
=========================

`PyCon 2012`_ is coming up in just a few short months, and PyPy will be well
represented there.  We'll be delivering a tutorial, two talks, plus we'll be
around for the sprints.

Here are the abstracts for the tutorials and talks:

* **How to get the most out of your PyPy**, by Maciej Fijalkowski, Alex Gaynor
  and Armin Rigo: For many applications PyPy can provide performance benefits
  right out of the box. However, little details can push your application to
  perform much better. In this tutorial we'll give you insights on how to push
  PyPy to it's limits. We'll focus on understanding the performance
  characteristics of PyPy, and learning the analysis tools in order to maximize
  your applications performance. *This is the tutorial.*

* **Why PyPy by example**, by Maciej Fijalkowski, Alex Gaynor and Armin Rigo:
  One of the goals of PyPy is to make existing Python code faster, however an
  even broader goal was to make it possible to write things in Python that
  previous would needed to be written in C or other low-level language. This
  talk will show examples of this, and describe how they represent the
  tremendous progress PyPy has made, and what it means for people looking to
  use PyPy.

* **How the PyPy JIT works**, by Benjamin Peterson: The Python community is
  abuzz about the major speed gains PyPy can offer pure Python code. But how
  does PyPy JIT actually work? This talk will discuss how the PyPy JIT is
  implemented. It will include descriptions of the tracing, optimization, and
  assembly generation phases. I will demonstrate each step with a example loop.

If you have any questions let us know!  We look forward to seeing people at
PyCon and chatting about PyPy and the entire Python ecosystem.

See you there,
Maciej Fijalkowski, Alex Gaynor, Benjamin Peterson, Armin Rigo, and the entire PyPy team
