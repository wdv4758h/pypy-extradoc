NOTES AND DONE TASKS 
-----------------------------

  - (arigo,cfbolz,pedronis) review/refactor new-architecture.txt 
    
  - (fijal intends to drop around 7-8pm) 
    play1 additional features 
    - pending updates of docs
    - snapshotting current state 

  - (cfbolz, done?) getting-started links and version numbers
    (antocuni) link precompiled windows binaries 

  - (pedronis, in-progress) tarball packaging and testing 
    - tarball can be prepared now, only doc-changes pending 

  - (mwh,pedronis,hpk,ALL)
    finalise release announcement 

  - (cfbolz) write news entry

  - send out of announcements to lists: 
    - (pedronis) pypy-dev pypy-funding
    - (cf) c.l.py, c.l.py.announce
    - (arigo) llvm list, python-dev
    - (holger) Charles 


  - (done) update README, also link and version numbers!

  - (should be ok) briefly review FAQ


  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - test various config option configurations -- use build tool? (guido)
    - test windows situation (antocuni, fijal) -- seems generally good

  - integrate and test: 
    - (arigo,pedronis,arre, IN-PROGRESS): wp08 docs & examples, getting-started 
    - (cfbolz) test wp09 getting-started examples: after some fixing things seem to work
    - wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?  (christian looking into this currently) a bit of progress, but no feedback/interaction with DFKI/Danish yet. 


  - move pedronis/pypy-c-testing, pedronis/tarball-testing 
    and pypy/tool/build all into 
        
        http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/build

    directory and arigo's htmlconftest as a snapshot or external. 
    refactor docs to point to the tools correctly
    (build/bin/* probably) 


  - (done by NNN: fijal, NNN) play1 issues: 
    - rebuild pypy's to use the new readline stub (fixing ugly stdout/stdin interactions) 
    - review/refine help (add examples where necessary)
    - make examples execute more cleanly
    - fix linking (it gets easily confused if you click around), make correct 404 and 500 pages
    - discuss/do a JIT demo

  - (DROPPED for 1.0) include documentation/entry point for 
    the JS interpreter (santagada, fijal) 


  - (hpk, guido, DONE) review entry points from the play1 demos. 

  - (DONE), arigo,pedronis,hpk) fix test failures of translated PyPys 
    related to aop.py module modifying global compiler state and
    subsequent tests randomly breaking 


  - (DONE) consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: not pypymagic, not pypybuiltin, holger and cf to propose (done, result is __pypy__)
    - document pypybuiltin module (add docstrings) (done)
    - functions should only be there if the according option is enabled (e.g. method cache) (done)
    - functions only relating to py.py should not appear in translated version (unless they work :) (done) (cfbolz)

  - (done, still a bit of doc's/demo refinements maybe) 
    make transparent proxies more prominent 
    because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module (pypy/lib/tputil.py - in progress)
    - write/review documentation (in-progress)
    - fix bugs if any
    (hpk) 

    - (done) wp10 - basically complete, pending issues brought up in review
    - (done) wp08 code 

  - (done) make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report) (cfbolz) 

  - complete/debug jit on powerpc 
    (basically done) somewhat working

  - (done for release) debug jit on intel (arigo/pedronis/arre)
    appears to work well, gives nice speedups on suitably contrived examples

  - (done) document build tool usages (getting-started?)

  - (DONE, arigo) fix bad terminal behaviour of translated PyPy's 

    (contributing to play1 quirks)
