Multi-platform support
======================

status:

 - We currently have PyPy with Posix support running on the following
   platforms:

   - Linux ia32
   - Mac OS/X ia32
   - Mac OS/X powerpc
   - Windows ia32 (only limited, a few known issues, needs a maintainer)

todo:

 - In order to be a viable alternative to CPython, PyPy needs to be
   tested and run cleanly on more platforms than it currently does.
   Amd64 with Linux is probably the most urgent one, but there are
   probably others that have some problems.

It probably makes sense to put this item off until we are closer to
having a production ready system for the i386. We also have a possible
volunteer effort under way. It remains to be seen if it takes off.

expected outcome:

 - PyPy passes the suite of tests to the same level on Linux/amd64
   as on Linux/ia32.

dependencies:

 - None

 - However, it probably makes sense to put this item off until we are
   closer to having a production ready system for the ia32.

 - Somebody showed up o the PyPy IRC channel with an interest in
   putting together a group of people doing the port to amd64.
   It remains to be seen if this group takes off. If so, we may have
   a port earlier than expected.
