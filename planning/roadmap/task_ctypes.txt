Support app-level ctypes
========================

status:
 - Done (with a few minor exceptions).

todo:
 - As a first approach for providing C-level bindings, we should implement
   the ctypes module on top of already existing _ffi wrapper. This would

   (like SDL wrapper).

 - This is probably a medium-sized task.  The details of the ctypes semantics
   are messy and can only be found by poking around the implementation.

expected outcome:

dependencies:
