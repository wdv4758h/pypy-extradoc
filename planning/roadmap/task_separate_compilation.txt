Separate compilation
====================

status:

 - Currently PyPy has to be compiled as a monolithic system with all
   extension modules included at compile time.

todo:

 - To make porting third party modules reasonable, it should not be
   necessary to recompile all of PyPy every time you want to integrate
   a new extension module. This requires supporting separate
   compilation in our translation tool chain.

expected outcome:

dependencies:

 - None
