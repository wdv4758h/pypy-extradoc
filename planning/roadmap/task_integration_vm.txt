Integration with the hosting virtual machine
============================================

Status: 

 - pypy-cli can access and use .NET classes, through the clr module,
   but in a limited way. Advanced features such as delegates and
   inheritance from .NET classes are not supported yet.

 - pypy-jvm cannot access JVM classes.

Todo:

 - improve the clr module

 - refactor it so that most of the code can be shared between pypy-cli
   and pypy-jvm

 - create the equivalent for the JVM


Expected outcome:

 - ability to access to JVM and .NET classes as Jython and IronPython
   users expect


Dependencies:

 - `Refactor RPython external objects interface`_

.. _`Refactor RPython external objects interface`: task_external_objects.html
