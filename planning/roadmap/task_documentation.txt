PyPy Documentation 
==================

status: 

- large collection of online pypy/doc/* files, often out of date 
- large collection of EU reports (often more accurate than online docs) 
- index.txt, getting-started and play1 main entry points for pypy docs
- very hard to maintain the current documentation

todo: 

- analyze and assess existing documentation
- write 3-5 "books" (with multiple chapters), each by
  drafting the outline of a book and discussing it
  in the community
- move over parts of the online docs and the EU documents into the
  book(s)
- improve support for referencing and inlining source code and (tested) examples

expected outcome:

- sorted and much improved user and developer documentation
- easier to maintain the documentation
- possibility to create nice PDFs




notes:

titles might be e.g.: 

 - "Guide to the Python Standard Interpreter"
 - "Building and Programming with RPython"
 - "PyPy Architecture and Implementation"
 - "Extending and Embedding PyPy's Python Interpreter"
