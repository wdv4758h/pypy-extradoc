Catch up with CPython 2.5/2.6
=============================

status: 

 - PyPy already implements a few features of 2.5 (PEP 309, PEP 338,
   PEP 341, PEP 357, partition, any, all)
 - Currently underway (Google SOC 2008 project)

todo:
 - Implement these features that were new in CPython 2.5:

   - PEP 308 (not sure how much compiler support there already is)
   - PEP 328
   - PEP 342
   - PEP 342 (rumours are that parts of this PEP are already implemented
     and that the implementation has to be matched to the current spec in the PEP)
   - PEP 352
   - Cf. http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/other-lang.html for these changes:

     - defaultdict needs to be implemented (`__missing__` is already supported)
     - new __hash__ semantics
     - Default encoding ascii
     - UnicodeWarning
     - ImportWarning
     - class C(): pass

 - Merge Stdlib of Python 2.5/2.6
 - Implement Python 2.6 features (not so important if 2.5 is the goal
   for this task)

expected outcome:
 - PyPy supports Python 2.5 semantics and makes people with apps that use
   these happy.

dependencies:
 - None
