Add optimizations to the JIT
============================

status:

 - Optimizations for integer operations have been implemented. Benchmarks
   show speeds at the level of unoptimized C code, translating to a
   factor 60 faster than CPython.

todo:

 - A base set of optimizations include common operations on floats and
   strings as well as general call optimization. Fixing bugs in the
   current JIT implementation is also needed.

expected outcome:

 - Call optimizations should improve the excecution speed of general
   Python programs to be faster than under CPython.

 - String optimizations should speed up string intensive programs
   like web frameworks by at least an order of magnitude over CPython.

 - Float operations should run at a speed comparable to unoptimized C
   code; about 2 orders of magnitude faster than CPython.

dependencies:

 - The JIT refactoring should be done before in order not to do extra work.
