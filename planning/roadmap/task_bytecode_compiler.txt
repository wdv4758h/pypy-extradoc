Compile Python sources into JVM/.NET bytecode
=============================================

Status: 

 - pypy-jvm and pypy-cli interprets python bytecode

Todo:

 - make pypy-jvm and pypy-cli emitting native bytecode instead of
   interpreting python bytecode;

 - the plan is to reuse part of the JIT machinery to automatically
   convert the Python interpreter into a compiler

Expected outcome:

 - compilation to native bytecode should give a speedup around 2/2.5x;

 - emitting native bytecode is needed for doing some tasks that are
   possible with Jython/IronPython (i.e., writing applets)

Dependencies:

 - `Port the JIT to ootype`_
