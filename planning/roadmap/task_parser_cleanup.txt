Parser cleanup
==============

status:

 - The parser is in a rather sorry state. Making it support various
   versions of Python is currently a rather nasty job. It needs
   replacing with a more robust design. The estimates for this are
   probably too low, since they were based on the idea of improving
   the existing parser.  Subsequent attempts to improve the parser
   have prompted the idea of a rewrite.

todo:

 - Select a suitable model/toolkit for the implementation.

 - Build the parser.

expected outcome:

dependencies:

 - None
