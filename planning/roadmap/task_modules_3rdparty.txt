Third party module support
==========================

status:

todo:

 - There are some third party modules that would bring early adopters
   to PyPy. They would also serve as code coverage cases. Our time
   estimate is a guess on how much time we would need to spend to get
   enough traction in the community. 

expected outcome:

dependencies:

 - We should have our infrastucture for extension modules in place before
   deciding what modules make most sense to port.
