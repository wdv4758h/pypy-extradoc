Port more modules to rffi style
===============================

status:

todo:

 - Some standard modules written in C have already been ported to the
   rffi style, but more remain.

 - XXX Flesh out with some more details. Examples for example.

Move modules from app to interpreter level
==========================================

status:

todo:

 - Some modules are implemented in Python at application level. For
   preformance reasons, many of them should eventually be implemented
   at interpreter level.

 - These modules are: 

   - array
   - binascii
   - cPickle
   - cStringIO
   - cmath
   - collections
   - datetime
   - functional
   - functools(incomplete)
   - imp
   - itertools
   - _ctypes

expected outcome:

dependencies:

 - None

Write new modules
=================

status:

todo:

 - There are still some modules in the standard library that need writing
   before PyPy is a reasonable replacement for CPython. Exactly which
   ones needs some investigation.

 - XXX Flesh out with some more details. Examples for example.

XXX The three previous tasks should be merged, I think
