Support a GUI
=============

status:

todo:

 - One of the C extension modules that we need to have in order to get
   traction is support for one of the multi-platform GUI toolkits. The
   choice is probably between gtk (in use by olpc and others), Qt
   (written in c++, using SIP to get a cpython package) and wxWindows,
   with Tkinter as a possible fourth. Someone with more understanding
   of the Python community than us should make the pick. Which one
   would bring more users to PyPy? Would any one of them prompt
   proponents of other GUI toolkits to make their own ports?
