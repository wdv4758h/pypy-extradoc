This is a roadmap for the specific target of

"Making PyPy a viable replacement for CPython"

This does not include things like porting every C extension that
works for CPython, but it does include porting enough modules that
enough people can use PyPy in their daily production that they will
do the porting of modules and other tasks that are beyond the
resources of the core project.

These tasks are loosley ordered by categories (speed, extra features,
external modules) (XXX: have a more structured outline?)
