This is a roadmap for the specific target of

"Making PyPy a viable replacement for Jython and/or IronPython"

Currently, the biggest advantage of pypy-jvm and pypy-cli over Jython
and IronPython is compliance to CPython, which is already better than
their counterparts. However, a lot of work has still to be done before
they can be used in a production environment.

Speed-wise, pypy-jvm is already slightly faster than Jython; however,
pypy-cli is about 6x-10x slower than IronPython.
