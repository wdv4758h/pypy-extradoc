Pervasive Testing 
=================

status:
- automated nightly test runs of pypy tests on 32bit linux machine (wyvern)   

- automated nightly builds on tuatara (PowerPC OSX) for builds and benchmarks 

- nightly run of cpython regression tests on top of several pypy-c's 
  (running on samuele's linux Desktop machine) 

todo: 

- automated tests on the windows platform 
  (a dedicated remotely accessible windows machine
  which regularly runs the tests) 
- allow for all tests (see status above) to easily run on demand  
  and also from branches
- tool for sending testing data to a central place 
- display test results information centrally
- integrate with release tools and process 

expected outcome: 

- easy-to-track and to fix test-regressions 
- improved stability and consistency between platforms
- improvements to the release process 
- more community participation and contributions in analysing 
  and helping with testing problems
