Make pypy-jvm and pypy-cli multithreaded
========================================

Status: 

 - pypy-jvm and pypy-cli don't support multiple threads

Todo:

 - add the relevant locks to the Python interpreter in order to make
   pypy-jvm and pypy-cli thread-safe;

 - this task would be probably also useful for implementing a GIL-free
   threading model for low level backends;

Expected outcome:

 - ability to use use free threading in pypy-jvm and pypy-cli
