Refactor RPython external objects interface
===========================================

Status: 

 - RPython programs compiled with gencli can make limited use of .NET
   classes; it is possible to test them without translation by using
   Python for .NET.

 - genjvm does not support external objects at all

Todo:

 - refactor the code in gencli and make it shareable with genjvm

 - add support for external objects to genjvm; the idea is to make
   programs testable by using JPype_ or something similar

Expected outcome:

 - ability to use JVM classes from RPython programs
