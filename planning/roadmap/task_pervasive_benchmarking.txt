Pervasive Benchmarking
======================

status: 

- some microbenchmarks, but coverage not consistent
  (see pypy/translator/microbench) 
- some small-to-medium-sized apps as real-world benchmarks
- benchmarks run on one machine (tuatara), no collection of results

todo: 

- implement more micro- and more large-scale benchmarks
- benchmarks against cpython/pypy/jython/ironpython 
- run benchmarks automatically on more servers
- tool for sending benchmark data to a central place 
- display benchmarking and progress information centrally

expected outcome: 

- identification of slow areas of PyPy and for follow up work  
- faster PyPy (i.e. some easy-to-do fixing of speed bugs) 
- more community participation and contributions in analysing 
  and helping with speed problems
