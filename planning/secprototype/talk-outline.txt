* PyPy architecture

* space proxying and operation control:

   - thunk
   - taint

* easy to add new bytecode operations

* potentially we should be able to implement a large range
  of security polices

* our jit architecture should allow to remove some checks overhead

------------------------------------------------------------


* open design issues:

 - pure dynamic implementation: what kind of rules to avoid control
   flow information leaks

   - label restriction propagation
   - label restriction enforcing
   - how to attach "credentials" to executed code

- simple labels principals model (for prototyping)
