NEW TASKS
---------

- add in numpy.generic and the various subclasses, use them in returning
  instances from subscripting (and possibly internally), also make them valid
  for the dtype arguments (numpy-dtype-refactor branch)

- astype

- a good sort function

- indexing by arrays and lists

- endianness

- scalar types like numpy.int8 (numpy-dtype-refacotr branch)

- add multi-dim arrays (numpy-multidim-shards branch)

  - will need to refactor some functions

- frompyfunc to create ufuncs from python functions

- more ufuncs

- arange/linspace/other ranges

- numpy.flatiter array.flat and friends
