NEW TASKS
---------

- add in all base dtypes (bools, unsigned and signed ints, floats)

- get the correct dtype results for binops

- add more ways to select dtypes (aliases or more advanced code to choose the 
  types)

- add in numpy.generic and the various subclasses, use them in returning
  instances from subscripting (and possibly internally), also make them valid
  for the dtype arguments

- astype

- a good sort function

- indexing by tuples and lists

- add multi-dim arrays

  - will need to refactor some functions

  - do we keep single-dim arrays separate?
