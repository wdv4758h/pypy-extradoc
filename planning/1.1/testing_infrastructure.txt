This is a summary of the meeting held Fri 29 Aug 2008 about improving
our testing infrastructure.

People present (irc nicks):
arigato, fijal, hpk, ondrej, sanxiyn, pedronis, mon-mon, getxsick, iko,
bgola, exarkun, jacob22, antocuni

We discussed the current available machines, the state of buildbot work and requirements for out testing infrastructure.

We listed the following requirements:

- running pypy own tests

- running py.test -A tests with translated pypy-cs

- running CPython test suite with translated pypy-cs

- running tests on branches (possibly also from a tarball)

- nightly runs with the possibility to trigger runs manually

- covering Linux x86-32 and Windows 32 bits (given the current state
  it seems we need two machines for each platform, ones for pypy own
  tests and one for translating and running tests with translated
  pypyc-s)

After looking at the state of buildbot work we mainly decided to try
to extend buildbot usage to cover all our nightly testing
needs. exarkun and bigdog have already a buildbot based setup that can
do nightly translations: http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/build/bot/ .

We then looked at machines availability/assignments at least for the
development phase of switching over to buildbot.

wyvern.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de: buildmaster at least for the
experimenting phase, buildslave running pypy own tests (as it does
now)

cobra.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de: buildslave for translations and running
tests with translated pypys

snake.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de: seems to be an available Windows machine

The first steps to proceed along this path would be to make pypy trunk
and py.lib trunk work together (this needs probably to happen on a
pypy branch at first), we also need to provide status presentations in
buildbot to fit our needs, using the py.lib trunk py.test seems the
right direction to be able to gather the necessary information.

From a later separate discussion between pedronis and arigo: a
reasonable status presentation we may want to implement first would be
a generalization of the current output of pypy own tests nightly run.
