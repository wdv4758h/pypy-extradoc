1.1 release goals: PyPy Python Interpreter 
  - compliant to CPython 2.5
  - ctypes 
  - robustness 
  - source distribution that installs and 
    runs on Linux, OSX, Windows  
  - supports easy_install / setuptools 
  - works with django, pylons and many other apps 
  - features stackless, transparent proxies, xxx sandboxing
  - experimental .NET and JVM versions?? 

major todos: 

- cleanup of directories and maybe modularizing 
- documentation about writing new extension modules 
- integrate SoC 2.5 work, port lib-python to 2.5, fix remaining 2.5 issues 
- review ctypes skipped tests 
- threading works nicely 
- a build process that integrates well with distutils,
  should fail gracefully for c-extensions 
- setup automated windows testing, integrate testing "pypy-c"
  on all platforms, **have one central pypy-c testing page**
- check missing standard library modules
- trunk/dist separation, dist is automatically copied from
  trunk after all tests have passed 
- refactor documentation to have separated entry points: 
  - for users of the mainline PyPy Python Interpreter 
  - for advanced users/developers/experimenters of the PyPy Python Interpreter 
  - all the rest - toolchain, prolog, squeak, javascript 
- revise and cleanup play1 - run more things through sandboxing? 
- debian packaging? 
- check licensing/copyright situation and boilerplate
