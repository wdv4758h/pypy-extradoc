Introducing PyPy 1.2 release
============================

We are pleased to announce `PyPy's 1.2 release`_.
This version 1.2 is a major milestone and it is the first release to ship
a **Just-in-Time compiler** that is known to be faster than CPython
(and unladen swallow) on some real-world applications (or the best benchmarks
we could get for them). The main theme for the 1.2 release is **speed**.

The JIT is stable and we don't observe crashes. Nevertheless we would
recommend you to treat it as beta software and as a way to try out the JIT
to see how it works for you.

Highlights:

* The JIT compiler.

* Various interpreter optimizations that improve performance as well as help
  save memory. Read our `various`_ `blog`_ `posts`_ about achievements.

* Introducing a `new PyPy website`_ at pypy.org made by `tav`_ and improved
  by the PyPy team.

* Introducing `speed.pypy.org`_, a new service that monitors our performance
  nightly.

* There will be ubuntu packages on `PyPy's PPA`_ made by Bartosz Skowron,
  however various troubles prevented us from having them as of now.

Known JIT problems (or why you should consider this beta software) are:

* The only supported platform is 32bit x86 for now, we're looking for help with
  other platforms.

* It is still memory-hungry.  There is no limit on the amount of RAM that
  the assembler can consume; it is thus possible (although unlikely) that
  the assembler ends up using unreasonable amounts of memory.

If you want to try PyPy, go to the `download page`_ on our excellent new site
and find the binary for your platform. If the binary does not work (e.g. on
Linux, because of different versions of external .so dependencies), or if
your platform is not supported, you can `try building from the source`_.

The PyPy release team,

    Armin Rigo, Maciej Fijalkowski and Amaury Forgeot d'Arc

Together with

    Antonio Cuni, Carl Friedrich Bolz, Holger Krekel and Samuele Pedroni

and `many others`_.
