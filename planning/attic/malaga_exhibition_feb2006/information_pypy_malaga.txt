The Organization of the II Open Source World Conference would 
like to provide you with updated information on the general 
situation of the Conference and we enclose the final Programme.  

We would like to communicate that a change in the schedule of the 
Programme of the conference has taken place, being transferred 
the official opening session and the Key note speech to 12:00 
in the morning of the 15th of February, due to a series of reasons: 
to take advantage of the opportunity to have like lecturer of the 
opening session Michail Bletsas, from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT), Chief Connectivity Officer in charge of 
the Project 100$ Laptop and "One laptop per child", that it is 
being designed on the base of an open source operating system; 
we have also had to extend the number of sessions due to the 
important increase of speakers and the extension of the plenary 
session on patents, licences and IPR, motivated by the number of 
participants anticipated in the debate.

The Conference maintains a very high scientific and technical 
level and the diversity of speakers and participants that 
always we have tried and that without a doubt will enrich the 
results of this event. Around 200 speakers will participate 
along the next days in the sessions in Malaga. In relation to 
the attendance we have confirmed over 4500 participants with 
which we consider a presence throughout the three days around 
6000 attendees.

Shortly we will send you the instructions on how to get to the 
Trade Fair and Conference Centre of Malaga and once there where 
to pick your personalized accreditation.

In addition, inform you that tomorrow, the 10th is the last 
day to receive your presentation in case you haven’t sent it 
yet. If for any circumstance you can not do it, please get in 
contact with the Technical Secretariat at the Trade Centre asap.

Please keep in mind the change in the schedule! I want to 
encourage you take advantage of the opportunity of being able 
to listen to the key responsible of an exciting worldwide project 
for everybody.
 
Best regards,

Dear Speaker

For your comfort we will try to deliver your accreditation in the room of 
your Hotel. If you arrive directly to the Congress Centre, you can pick-up 
your accreditation at the Technical Secretariat, which will be located 
between both main auditoriums next to the central patio. We remain you 
that it is not necessary to go through the accreditation counters of the 
entrance hall. Please verify in the reception of the hotel the schedule of 
buses that leave towards the Congress Centre. 

We make available for all the attendees, free access points to high speed 
Internet located within the Exhibition between the stands. In case you prefer to connect with some own portable device with wireless connectivity, you will have also the possibility since all the facility WIFI connected 
for free access to the participants. In that case, you will only have to select 
the option of configuration of DHCP. However, if you have any problem on 
connectivity the technical personnel will be able to assist you.

We want also to indicate that there will be a room for speakers located in 
the first floor, Room nº 10, where it will be possible to update your presentation 
or to use some of the computers available for you. 

Before your session we recommended you to contact with the chair of your 
session directly or through the Technical Secretariat.  Please indicate to 
him/her how you want to de introduced and enumerate very briefly the 
two or three key points of your presentation.

We also remind you some previous information concerning your presentation 
already sent to you:

    * We recommend a 15 minutes oral presentation to allow some 
	discussion and Q&A time at the end of the session. To protect 
	the rights of your other colleague speakers and the rights of the 
	attendees to listen to all the presentation included on the programme,
	it would not be possible for any speaker to go beyond 20 minutes. The 
	chair has received instructions to be very strict on the timing due to the 
	above reasons. We ask for your kind cooperation on this issue.
	
    * The presentation format should be OpenOffice or PDF. Except exceptional 
	cases, only organization computers or laptops with preloaded presentations 
	will be used for the presentation at the conference rooms. In case that 
	you need to modify or update your presentation there will be available working 
	rooms at the Technical Secretariat or speaker’s room. There will be 
	also a technical team specialized in Open Source to support you in

We wish you a pleasant trip and look forward to welcome you in
