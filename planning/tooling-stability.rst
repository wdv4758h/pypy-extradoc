Tooling stability
-----------------

1) From PyPy 5, vmprof.com & the viewing of trace/assembler works with any pypy

2) We need at least crude headless tests for vmprof.com
  - performance of cpython 2.7, 3.5, pypy 5 and newer
  - jitviewer

3) local server for vmprof that loads the browser, without user management
