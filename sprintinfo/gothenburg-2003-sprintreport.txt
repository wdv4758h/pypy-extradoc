Gothenburg (May 2003)
=========================

The major focus of the sprint was to make the interpreter chain complete. A 
first goal was to make "Hello world" run and this was accomplished about half 
way into the sprint. We then proceded to making a more complex program that 
had operations involving string operations and dictionaries work. This was 
accomplished before the end of the sprint.

There was a big discussion, mostly involving Armin and Samuele over how to 
handle operator dispatching. This ended in the Multimethod dispatcher that 
mostly still survives in the Standard Object Space.
