Hildesheim2 PyPy sprint 
======================================================

The next internal PyPy sprint is scheduled 25th-31st July 2005 
at Trillke-Gut, Hildesheim, Germany.  Its focus will be 
intensely working on getting a self-contained PyPy version. 

Currently scheduled to come:: 

    Armin Rigo 23rd-1st
    Samuele Pedroni 24th-1st 
    Christian Tismer 25th-31st (?)
    Carl Friedrich Bolz 24th-31st (not there on 27th) 
    Holger Krekel 24th-31st 
    Richard Emslie 24th-1st 

Anyone, who is somewhat experienced with PyPy already, 
is invited to come.  For new people it will make more 
sense to attend the next big public sprint in Heidelberg
(also Germany) end of August. 

Location & Accomodation  
------------------------ 

The sprint will be held in the merlinux offices (or in a larger 
room if more people decide to come). 

Holger tries to organize private accomodation for all participants. 
However, attendees should be prepared to share a room with
another participant.  Also the rooms will be located in a
living group (german WG).  If you want something more separate
or private, ask holger to look for a hotel closeby. 

Getting there 
-----------------

Take a train to "Hildesheim Hauptbahnhof" (there are ICE's from 
Berlin and the south of germany, or trains from Hannover, use 
http://www.bahn.de to plan).  Then take the bus number 3 
direction "Hildesheimer Wald" and get out at "Waldquelle". 
The full address is:: 

    Trillke-Gut 
    Steinbergstr. 42
    31139 Hildesheim
