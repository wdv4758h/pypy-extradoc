========================================================================

Where PyPy meets Oz !

Monday and Tuesday to work on PyPy (WP10: logic programming).
Wednesday and Thursday to meet with the people behind Oz.
Friday to work on PyPy.

Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

While attendees of the sprint are of course welcome to work on what
they wish, we offer these ideas:

  - Experiment with the constraint store and dataflow variables added
    as a library to PyPy.

  - Investigate lazy evaluation and concurrency in Python using
    coroutines and stackless features.

  - Discuss possible syntactical integration of the new logic-related 
    features

  - Come to a shared understanding of what can and cannot be imported
    from Oz

  - more if possible...
