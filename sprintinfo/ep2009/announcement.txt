==================================================================
Birmingham (UK) EuroPython PyPy Sprints 28-29 June/ 3-4 July 2009
==================================================================

The PyPy team is sprinting at EuroPython again. This year there are
`sprint days`_ before (28-29 June) and after (3-4 July) the
conference. Some PyPy core people should be present during both periods.

.. _`sprint days`: http://wiki.europython.eu/Sprints

If you plan to attend the sprints after the conference we recommend
you to listen to the PyPy technical talk (`EuroPython schedule`_)
during the conference since it will give you a good overview of the
status of development.

Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

There are many possible and interesting sprint topics to work on - here
we list some possible task areas:

 - trying out software on PyPy's Python interpreter:
   the CPython test suite is not all that complete, therefore the fact that we
   pass most tests is no real indication of bug-freeness. We have tried and
   know that frameworks like Django and Twisted work with PyPy. Therefore we would
   like to try running more "real applications" on top of the Python interpreter
   (ideally ones that have a good test suite themselves and that don't need
   unusual extension modules). Running things on Windows is also interesting,
   we know our coverage there is not as good as on Linux.

 - check and improve Mac OS X support

 - starting to work on porting 2.6 features to PyPy's Python interpreter

 - ongoing JIT generator work

 - of course we are open to other ideas for what to work on. Examples could
   be working on other language interpreters, sandboxing, ...
