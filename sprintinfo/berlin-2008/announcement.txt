=====================================================================
         PyPy Berlin Sprint (17-22nd May 2008)
=====================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in the crashed `c-base space station`_,
Berlin, Germany, Earth, Solar System.  This is a fully public sprint:
newcomers (from all planets) and topics other than those proposed below
are welcome.

.. _`c-base space station`: http://www.c-base.org/


------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

  - work on PyPy's JIT generator: we are refactoring parts of the
    compiling logic, in ways that may also allow generating better
    machine code for loops (people or aliens with knowledge on
    compilers and SSA, welcome)

  - work on the SPy VM, PyPy's Squeak implementation, particularly the
    graphics capabilities

  - work on PyPy's GameBoy emulator, which also needs graphics support

  - trying some large pure-Python applications or libraries on PyPy and
    fixing the resulting bugs. Possibilities are Zope 3, Django and
    others.

* We are open to all sorts of other tasks during the sprint, just
  propose something.

Location & Accomodation

To get there, take the U-Bahn or S-Bahn to the station
"Jannowitzbrücke". See here_ for a map to get to c-base from there.

If you want to come, please register via by svn:

  http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc/sprintinfo/berlin-2008/people.txt

or write a mail to the pypy-sprint mailing list if you do not yet have
check-in rights:

  http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/pypy-sprint

Of course, especially given the location, it's ok to show up even if you
didn't register.  (The c-base has probably got the plans of Guido's
famous time machine anyway, so you can register last week.)

Exact times

The sprint will be from 17th to 22nd of May 2008. We will start
sprinting every day at 10. An introduction will be given on the first
day, if there is interest.
