  - work on PyPy's JIT generator: we are refactoring parts of the
    compiling logic, in ways that may also allow generating better
    machine code for loops (people or aliens with knowledge on
    compilers and SSA, welcome)

  - trying some large pure-Python applications or libraries on PyPy and
    fixing the resulting bugs. Possibilities are Zope 3, Django and
    others.
