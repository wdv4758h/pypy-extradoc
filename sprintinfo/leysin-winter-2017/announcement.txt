=====================================================================
      PyPy Leysin Winter Sprint (25/26th Feb. - 4th March 2016)
=====================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the twelveth time.
This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics other than those
proposed below are welcome.

------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

The list of topics is very open.

* The main topic is Python 3.5 support in PyPy, as most py3.5
  contributors should be present.  It is also a good topic if you have
  no or limited experience with PyPy contribution: we can easily find
  something semi-independent that is not done in py3.5 so far, and
  do pair-programming with you.

* Any other topic is fine too: JIT compiler optimizations, CFFI,
  the RevDB reverse debugger, improving to speed of your program on
  PyPy, etc.

* And as usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-)
  We can take a day off (for ski or anything else).

-----------
Exact times
-----------

Work days: starting 26th Feb (~noon), ending March 4th (~noon).

I have pre-booked the week from Saturday Feb 25th to Saturday March 4th.
If it is possible for you to arrive Sunday before mid-afternoon, then
you should get a booking from Sunday only.  The break day should be
around Wednesday.

It is fine to stay a few more days on either side, or conversely to book
for a part of that time only.

-----------------------
Location & Accomodation
-----------------------

Leysin, Switzerland, "same place as before".  Let me refresh your
memory: both the sprint venue and the lodging will be in a
pair of chalets built specifically for bed & breakfast:
http://www.ermina.ch/.  The place has a good ADSL Internet connection
with wireless installed.  You can also arrange your own lodging
elsewhere (as long as you are in Leysin, you cannot be more than a 15
minutes walk away from the sprint venue).

Please *confirm* that you are coming so that we can adjust the
reservations as appropriate.

The options of rooms are a bit more limited than on previous years
because the place for bed-and-breakfast is shrinking; but we should
still have enough room for us.  The price is around 60 CHF, breakfast
included, in shared rooms (3 or 4 people).  If there are people that
would prefer a double or single room, please contact me and we'll see
what choices you have.  There are also a choice of hotels in Leysin.

You need a Swiss-to-(insert country here) power adapter.  There will be
some Swiss-to-EU adapters around, and at least one EU-format power strip.
