People coming to the Leysin sprint Winter 2016
==================================================

People who have a ``?`` in their arrive/depart or accomodation
column are known to be coming but there are no details 
available yet from them.

**NOTE:** lodging is by default in Ermina.  There are two ~4 people
rooms as well as smaller rooms on demand.  (Individual rooms should be
available if needed, but ask Armin Rigo.)

Of course you're free to book a different hotel yourself if you prefer.

The standard booking is for the nights from Saturday to Saturday, but it
is possible to extend that.  If it is possible for you to arrive Sunday
not too late, then you should get a booking from Sunday only.  We'll
work from Sunday noon-ish to the next Saturday (with a break day in the
middle of the week).
