=====================================================================
         PyPy London Sprint (August 26 - September 1 2013)
=====================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in London, United Kingdom for the first
time. This is a fully public sprint. PyPy sprints are a very good way
to get into PyPy development and no prior PyPy knowledge is necessary.


------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

For newcomers:

* bring your application/library and we'll help you port it to PyPy,
  benchmark and profile

* come and write your favorite missing numpy function

* help us work on developer tools like jitviewer

We'll also work on:

* refactoring the JIT optimizations

* STM and STM-related topics

* anything else attendants are interested in

-----------
Exact times
-----------

The work days should be August 26 - September 1 2013 (Monday-Sunday).
The official plans are for people to arrive on the 26th, and
to leave on the 2nd. There will be a break day in the middle.
We'll typically start at 10:00 in the morning.
