Tasks
-----

* fix the issue with the os.xyz attributes not showing up depending on
  which host we use during translation.
  Maybe revive branch 'missing-os-functions'.

* cffi 1.0: think about how to separate compilation from execution of
  the script (e.g. a separate foo.c file, and "python -m cffi foo.c")

* cffi: think about and collect which C-extensions we would like to bring to cffi

* PYPYLOG output: they need to be disentangled when the process uses
  threads or greenlets, probably by adding a thread-or-greenlet number
  prefix (see branch stmgc-c4 where we already add a thread num prefix)

* general STM things (Remi, Armin) TINY BUG FIXED, PROGRESS

* don't release the GIL in random places DONE

* general Numpy things NO HARD BUGS IN TRACKER
