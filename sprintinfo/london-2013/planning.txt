Tasks
-----

* fix the issue with the os.xyz attributes not showing up depending on
  which host we use during translation.
  Maybe revive branch 'missing-os-functions'.

* cffi 1.0: think about how to separate compilation from execution of
  the script (e.g. a separate foo.c file, and "python -m cffi foo.c")
