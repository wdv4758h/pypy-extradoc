Tasks
-----

* fix the issue with the os.xyz attributes not showing up depending on
  which host we use during translation.
  Maybe revive branch 'missing-os-functions'.

* cffi 1.0: think about how to separate compilation from execution of
  the script (e.g. a separate foo.c file, and "python -m cffi foo.c")

* cffi: think about and collect which C-extensions we would like to bring to cffi

* PYPYLOG output: they need to be disentangled when the process uses
  threads or greenlets, probably by adding a thread-or-greenlet number
  prefix (see branch stmgc-c4 where we already add a thread num prefix)

* general STM things (Remy, Armin)

* general Numpy things (Marko, Romain)

* fix some of the RPython nits that Edd found (Ronan, Edd)

* continue less-stringly-ops

* better error messages (Ronan, Edd)

* programming

* JIT for dont-know-yet (Richard, Lukas)

* explore Laurie's crazy scheme of persisting loop entry counts (Maciej, Laurie)

* progress on the documentation branch (Olmo, Manuel)

* improve installation instruction (Olmo, Manuel)

* shave all the yaks

* find the slow generator task (Marko, Romain)

* general wizardry (Carl Friedrich; Armin)

* general getting started (Rami, Carl Friedrich)
