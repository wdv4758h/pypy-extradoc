Tasks
-----

* fix the issue with the os.xyz attributes not showing up depending on
  which host we use during translation.
  Maybe revive branch 'missing-os-functions'.

* cffi 1.0: think about how to separate compilation from execution of
  the script (e.g. a separate foo.c file, and "python -m cffi foo.c")

* cffi: think about and collect which C-extensions we would like to bring to cffi

* PYPYLOG output: they need to be disentangled when the process uses
  threads or greenlets, probably by adding a thread-or-greenlet number
  prefix (see branch stmgc-c4 where we already add a thread num prefix)

* general STM things ONE STEP FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK

* general Numpy things NO HARD BUGS IN TRACKER

* make numpy.unicode_ not segfault IN PROGRESS

* track raw array out of bounds in lldebug builds (Anto) IN PROGRESS

* PyOpenCL FIRST DEMO RUNNING ON PYPY

* fix some of the RPython nits that Edd found SOME PROGRESS

* continue less-stringly-ops and other RPython cleanups MERGED

* even better error messages for RPython DONE

* programming (all)

* JIT for xlispx (Richard, Carl Friedrich around) KIND OF TAIL RECURSIVE
