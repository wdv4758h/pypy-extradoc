Leysin (April 2006)
=============================0

Armin, Arre and Samuele started with 2 days working on the JIT. When others 
joined the sprint focus changed and there was a bunch of work on fixing 
translation to work with stackless features and other stuff. There was also 
some work done on the constraints package.

People I remember being there:
Armin, Arre, Samuele, Holger, Michael, Alexandre, Aurelien
