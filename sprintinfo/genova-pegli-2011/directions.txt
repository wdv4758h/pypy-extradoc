How to go to Genova Pegli
=========================

By train
--------

- http://www.trenitalia.com

- Take a long distance train to Genova Piazza Principe or Genova Brignole
  (both works; in case of doubt, pick Genova Principe as it's slightly closer
  to Pegli)

- From there, take a regional train to Genova Pegli: take one whose final
  destination is Genova Voltri, Savona or Ventimiglia.  Beware that not all of
  those actually stops in Pegli, so make sure that yours does :-) (in case of
  doubt, you can ask a random person on the platform, they'll know it for
  sure)

- You can search for the timetable at the trenitalia.com website
