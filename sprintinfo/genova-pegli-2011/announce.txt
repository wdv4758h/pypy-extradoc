PyPy Genova-Pegli Post-EuroPython Sprint June 27 - July 2 2011
==============================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Genova-Pegli, Italy, the week after EuroPython
(which is in Florence, about 3h away by train). This is a fully public sprint:
newcomers and topics other than those proposed below are welcome.

------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

* Now that we have released 1.5, the sprint itself is going to be
  mainly working on fixing issues reported by various users. Of
  course this does not prevent people from showing up with a more
  precise interest in mind.  If there are newcomers, we will gladly
  give introduction talks.

* We will also work on polishing and merging the long-standing
  branches that are around, which could eventually lead to the
  next PyPy release.  These branches are notably:

  - jitypes2 (fast ctypes calls with the JIT)
  - XXX?

* Since we are almost on the beach, we can take one day off for summer
  relaxation and/or tourist visits nearby :-).

-----------
Exact times
-----------

The work days should be 27 June - 2 July 2011.  People may arrive on
the 26th already and/or leave on the 3rd.  XXX checkin or checkout times?
if there is no specific time, say that.

-----------------------
Location & Accomodation
-----------------------

Both the sprint venue and the lodging will be at Albergo Puppo[1] in
Genova-Pegli, Italy.  Pegli is a nice and peaceful little quarter of Genova,
and the hotel is directly on the beach, making it a perfect place for those
who want to enjoy the sea in the middle of the Italian summer, as a quick
search on Google Images shows[2] :-)

The place has a good ADSL Internet connexion with wireless installed.  You can
of course arrange your own lodging anywhere but I definitely recommend lodging
there too.

Please *confirm* that you are coming so that we can adjust the reservations as
appropriate.  The prices are as follows, and they include breakfast and a
parking place for the car, in case you need it:

  - single room:  70 €
  - double room:  95 €
  - triple room: 105 €
