How to support the notion of extension modules
==============================================

participants: Maciek, Armin, Alexander, Richard, Jacob, Christian

two approaches
 - app-level ctypes
   - idea is to have pygame-ctypes as an intermediate goal
   - the hard bit is callbacks
   - only applevel code, which is good
   - making ctypes_platform a generally useful thing (even for CPython)

 - separate compilation, mixed modules
   - two step process:
     - prototyping for faster module development
     - really loading the module later
   - boehm only
   - would allow to wrap C libs with rffi
   - annotations on the object space method fixed
   - fixed names for those in the C library
   - duplication of low-level helpers, rlib

the first one is easier to implement, to use, more useful for external people,
which is why it is a priority (but we will need both eventually)

far future idea: can we support CPython C extensions?
