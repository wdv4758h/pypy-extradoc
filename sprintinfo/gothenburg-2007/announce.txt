PyPy Göteborg Cleanup Sprint November 19 - November 25 2007
===============================================================

The next post-EU-project PyPy sprint will be in Gothenburg, Sweden. It will
focus on cleaning up the PyPy codebase and making it ready for the next round
of improvements. It is a "public" sprint but it will probably be more suitable
for people already somewhat acquainted with PyPy.

Topics and goals
----------------

Meta-Tasks
++++++++++

 - Tracker-gardening
 - Start slowly thinking about 1.1 plans

Translation toolchain
+++++++++++++++++++++


 - finish rctypes removal

 - move away from implicit keepalives
 - raw_malloc should be split, rffi one should not use obmalloc (it's
   not thread-safe)
 - kill simulator, run the semi space tests on llinterp (may happen
   before)
 - have a moving gc correct version of the gc framework transformation
 - delegate finding type stuff like vtables etc to GC, cleaner interface
   for rtti, simplify translator/c/gc.py
 - think about approaches to id, especially concerning boehm, where the
   id will keep the object alive and concerning a moving GC

 - clean up the tangle of including headers in the C backend

 - review pdbplus, especially the graph commands, also in the light of
   https://codespeak.net/issue/pypy-dev/issue303 and the fact that we
   can have more than one translator/annotator around (with the
   timeshifter)

 - Kill half concrete wrapper
 
 - Kill opaque hacks on the C backend
  
 - decide how to implement constants in rffi
   
 - think about/remove orphaned parts
    
 - finish ll2ctypes, especially rffi_platform

Interpreter
+++++++++++

 - there's a shadow tracking bug it seems

 - fix the taint space

 - review the things implemented at applevel whether they are
   performance-critical

JIT
+++

 - start writing real unit tests for the merging logic


Location
--------

The sprint will be held in the apartment of Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallén
which is at Götabergsgatan 22 in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Here is a map_.  This is
in central Gothenburg.  It is between the tram_ stops of Vasaplatsen and Valand,
where many lines call.

Probably cheapest and not too far away is to book accomodation at `SGS
Veckobostader`_. There are also hotels to suit every price range and desire for
luxury.  Just ask in the mailing list.
