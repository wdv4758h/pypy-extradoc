Thanks to Mike MÃ¼ller for inviting us.

The room holds 8 - 12 people depending how much space each individual
needs.  Drinks, snacks and a simple lunch, e.g. pizza or other fast food
is provided.  Dinner would be extra.

Some accommodations:

Pretty much all hotels and hostels in the city center
are fine too. The tram needs only 16 minutes from the
central station to the Academy location.

funds.  Additionally, we can support you applying for grants from the
PSF and other sources.
