Leipzig PyPy sprint June 22 - 27, 2012
======================================

The next PyPy sprint will be held --- for the first time in a while ---
in a place where we haven't been so far: Leipzig, Germany, at the
`Python Academy`_'s Teaching Center.  It will take place from the 22nd
to the 27th of June 2012, before EuroPython.  Thanks to Mike Müller for
organizing it!

This is a fully public sprint, everyone is welcome to join us.  All days are
full sprint days, so it is recommended to arrive the 21st and leave the 28th.


Topics and goals
----------------

Open.  Here are some goals:

- numpy: progress towards completing the ``numpypy`` module; try to
  use it in real code

- stm: progress on Transactional Memory; try out the ``transaction``
  module on real code.

- jit optimizations: there are a number of optimizations we can still
  try out or refactor.

- work on various, more efficient data structures for Python language.
  A good example would be lazy string slicing/concatenation or more efficient
  objects.

- any other PyPy-related topic is fine too.


Location
--------

Python Academy Leipzig, Germany.

Thanks to Mike Müller for inviting us.

The room holds 8 - 12 people depending how much space each individual
needs.  Drinks, snacks and a simple lunch, e.g. pizza or other fast food
is provided.  Dinner would be extra.

Some accommodations:

Pretty much all hotels and hostels in the city center
are fine too. The tram needs only 16 minutes from the
central station to the Academy location.


Grants
------

For students, we have the possibility to support some costs via PyPy
funds.  Additionally, we can support you applying for grants from the
PSF and other sources.
