PyPy Göteborg Post-Easter Sprint April 25 - May 1 2011
======================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Gothenburg, Sweden. It is a public sprint, 
very suitable for newcomers.  We'll focus on making the 1.5 release (if
it hasn't already happened) and whatever interests the Sprint attendees.

Topics and goals
----------------

The main goal is to polish and release PyPy 1.5, supporting Python 2.7
as well as the last few months' improvements in the JIT (provided that
it hasn't already happened).  Other topics:

- Going over our documentation, and classifying our docs in terms of
  mouldiness.  Deciding what needs writing, and maybe writing it.

- Helping people get their code running with PyPy

- maybe work on EuroPython Training, and talks

- Summer of Code preparation

- speed.pypy.org 

- any other programming task is welcome too -- e.g. tweaking the
  Python or JavaScript interpreter, Stackless support, and so on.

Location
--------

The sprint will be held in the apartment of Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallén
which is at Götabergsgatan 22 in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Here is a map_.  This is
in central Gothenburg.  It is between the tram_ stops of Vasaplatsen and 
Valand, (a distance of 4 blocks) where many lines call -- the 2, 3, 4, 5,
7, 10 and 13.

Probably cheapest and not too far away is to book accomodation at `SGS
Veckobostader`_. The  `Elite Park Avenyn Hotel`_ is a luxury hotel just a 
few blocks away. There are scores of hotels a short walk away from the
sprint location, suitable for every budget, desire for luxury, and desire
for the unusual.  You could, for instance, stay on a `boat`_.  Options are
too numerous to go into here. Just ask in the mailing list or on the blog.

Hours will be
from 10:00 until people have had enough.  It's a good idea to arrive a
day before the sprint starts and leave a day later.  In the middle of
the sprint there usually is a break day and it's usually ok to take
half-days off if you feel like it.


Good to Know
------------

Sweden is not part of the Euro zone. One SEK (krona in singular, kronor
in plural) is roughly 1/10th of a Euro (9.36 SEK to 1 Euro).

The venue is central in Gothenburg.  There is a large selection of
places to get food nearby, from edible-and-cheap to outstanding.  We
often cook meals together, so let us know if you have any food allergies,
dislikes, or special requirements.

Sweden uses the same kind of plugs as Germany. 230V AC.

The Sprint will be held the week following Easter.  This means, as always,
that Gothcon_ will be taking place the weekend before (Easter weekend).
Gothcon, now in its 35 year, is the largest European game players conference.
Some of you may be interested in arriving early for the board games.
The conference site is only in Swedish, alas.  You don't need to register
in advance unless you are planning to host a tournament, (and it's too
late for that anyway).

Getting Here
------------
If are coming train, you will arrive at the `Central Station`_.  It is
about 12 blocks to the site from there, or you can take a tram_. 

There are two airports which are local to Göteborg, `Landvetter`_ (the main
one) and `Gothenburg City Airport`_ (where some budget airlines fly).
If you arrive at `Landvetter`_  the airport bus stops right downtown at
`Elite Park Avenyn Hotel`_ which is the second stop, 4 blocks from the
Sprint site, as well as the end of the line, which is the `Central Station`_.
If you arrive at `Gothenburg City Airport`_ take the bus to the end of the
line.  You will be at the  `Central Station`_.

You can also arrive by ferry_, from either Kiel in Germany or Frederikshavn
in Denmark.
