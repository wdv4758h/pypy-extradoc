Düsseldorf PyPy sprint November 6 - November 13 2009
=====================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be held in the Computer Science department of
Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf from the 6th to the 13th of
November 2009. This is a fully public sprint, everyone is welcome to
join us.

Topics and goals
----------------

At the sprint we intend to work on the JIT generator in PyPy and on
applying it to PyPy Python interpreter.

The precise work that will be done is not fixed, as we don't know in
which state the JIT will be in November.  However, possible areas of
work might include:

- tweaking the interpreter/objspace to be more JIT-friendly, e.g.
  instance implementation code, call code
- if there is interest starting non x86-32 JIT backends
- trying out existing software to find features where the optimizations
  of the JIT could be improved
- improving our benchmarking infrastructure

We will give special priority to topics that "non-core" people find
interesting (as long as they are somehow JIT-related).

For an introduction of how our JIT-generation process works, please
refer to our blog:

There is also a more dense academic paper about the subject:

Location
--------

The sprint will take place in a seminar room of the computer science
department.  It is in the building 25.12 of the university campus. For
