========================================================
Wrocław PyPy sprint 7-14th February, 2009
========================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be held in Wrocław, Poland. This is fully public
sprint and all newcomers are welcomed. Preceeding the sprint there
will be a talk at University of Technology in Wrocław held at 22nd of January.

Worth noting is that this is a perfect time and place to go cross country
skiing either before or after sprint, so if anyone wants to participate in
such activity, we can organize something.
