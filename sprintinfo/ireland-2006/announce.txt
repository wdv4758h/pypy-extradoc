Ireland PyPy sprint 21th-27th August 2006
====================================================

The next PyPy sprint will happen in the nice city of 
Limerick in Ireland from 21st till 27th August.  
(Most people intend to arrive 20th August). 

The main focus of the sprint will be on JIT compiler works, 
various optimization works, porting extension modules, 
infrastructure works like a build tool for PyPy, or 
extended (distributed) testing. 

It's also open to new topics.  If you are a student
consider to participate in `Summer of PyPy`_ in order 
get funding for your travels and accomodation. 

The sprint is being hosted by University of Limerick
(http://www.ul.ie/) - and is arranged in co-operation
with people from our sister project Calibre (www.calibre.ie).
Our contact at the University is Pär Ågerfalk and Eoin
Oconchuir.

Workshop parallell to the first day of the sprint, 21st of August
------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the first day (21st of August) there will be in parallell to the sprint:

* a workshop covering more in-depth methodology aspects of PyPy 
  aiming at explaining the pros and cons of sprint-driven development.
  (suited for sprint attendants, students, staff and other 
  interested parties from/around the University and the local area)

The workshop participants (mostly University of Limerick researchers) will 
observe the sprint during parts of the first day, film an take pictures as well.


Tutorial, PyPy introduction and dinner on friday, 25th of August
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

During friday we will arrange a tutorial and technical 
introduction to the PyPy codebase, followed by a Q&A session. This session was originally
planned for the first day but we moved it to friday afternoon in order to 
make it easier for people from the irish python group to participate. 
This tutorial session starts at 5pm. At 8pm we go for a nice dinner together.

This friday afternoon tutorial session and dinner is open for anyone interested,
you do not have to be a sprint participant to join us for this event.
