Duesseldorf PyPy sprint October 30 - November 5 2006
=====================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be held in the Computer Science department of
Heinrich-Heine Universitaet Duesseldorf from the 30th of October to the 5th of
November 2006.

Topics and goals
----------------

The topics of the sprints are not fixed yet.  We will progress on the subjects
that we are currently working on, while giving a special priority to any topic
that "non-core" people find interesting.  There are many topics that could fit
both category :-)  Here are some examples:

* Just-In-Time work.  Two sub-topics:

  - write and/or optimize a machine-code backend (we have 386 only so far)
  - work on turning simple interpreters into JIT compilers (we cannot do
    this for the whole of the PyPy interpreter yet, we're getting there
    small step by small step).

* Optimization of core Python data types, making full 
  use of PyPy's flexible architecture and python-implemented  
  (and then translated) type system.  (We have already various dict and
  str implementations.)

* "Next-step stuff" that will requires some thinking and design:

  - distribution (where a single program runs on multiple machines)
  - persistence (save an "image" of a running program, or a part of it)
  - security (in many possible senses of the word)

* Working on py.test testing tool: 

  - py.test recently grew some distribution features which are still rough
    around the edges and could use improvement

  - there are some more ideas for features of py.test around, like adding
    profiling capabilities (and more)

* Work on the PyPy build tool: There are some plans to provide a tool that
  allows one to flexibly configure PyPy and to also request builds from a set
  of build servers. If there is interest there could be work in this area.

* and as always, there is the topic of implementing or completing core
  extension modules (e.g. socket...).  This is hacking with a mix of
  ctypes and RPython.


Location
--------

The sprint will (probably) take place in a seminar room of
the geography department (which is getting assimilated by the cs
department and is below it).  It is in the building 25.12 of the
university campus. For travel instructions see

If you'd like to come, please subscribe to the `pypy-sprint mailing list`_
and drop a note about your interests and post any questions.  More 
organisational information will be send to that list.  We'll keep
a list of `people`_ which we'll update (which you can do so yourself
if you have codespeak commit rights).
