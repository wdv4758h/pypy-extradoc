The PyPy team is heading for a new sprint meetup, this time

with small devices.   We are also open to other sprint topics!

The sprint is going to take place at the Computer Science
department of Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf (Germany).  

Infos in a nutshell: 

arrival day: Sunday, 5th October 

departure day: Monday, 13th October 

sprint days: 6-12th october with breaks 

Location: Seminar room of the computer science department, situated 
in the building 25.12 of the university campus, second
floor. For travel instructions see

Accomodation
------------------------------

We may be able to fit some people into private flats 
and otherwise there are several hotels, one recommended 
one is the http://www.hotel-hillesheim.de/ where we are
investigating regarding a cheaper group rate. 
Please register ASAP if you want to benefit. 

There are also some hotels that are used by visitors to the university and are
quite close to the uni. None of us have been at them, so we have no experience
of how good they are.

1. Hotel Blättler

2. Hotel Mooren

3. Hotel Europa
can't seem to find a website

4. Schloss Mickeln
This one is the guest house of the university in a very beautiful castle.
Supposed to be extremely nice, but also expensive.
