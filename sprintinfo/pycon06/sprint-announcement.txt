Post-PyCon PyPy Sprint: February 27th - March 2nd 2006 
============================================================

The next PyPy sprint is scheduled to take place right after 
PyCon 2006 in Dallas, Texas, USA. 

We hope to see lots of newcomers at this sprint, so we'll give
friendly introductions.  Note that during the Pycon conference 
we are giving PyPy talks which serve well as preparation.  

Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

While attendees of the sprint are of course welcome to work on what
they wish, we offer these ideas:

  - Work on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.

  - Writing ctypes implementations of modules to be used by the above
    tool. 

  - Experimenting with different garbage collection strategies.

  - Implementing Python 2.5 features in PyPy

  - Implementation of constraints solvers and integration of dataflow
    variables to PyPy.

  - Implement new features and improve the 'py' lib and py.test 
    which are heavily used by PyPy (doctests/test selection/...).

  - Generally experiment with PyPy -- for example, play with
    transparent distribution of objects or coroutines and stackless
    features at application level.

  - Have fun!

Location
--------

The sprint will be held wherever the PyCon sprints end up being held,
which is to say somewhere within the Dallas/Addison Marriott Quorum
hotel.
