Duesseldorf PyPy sprint 2-9 June 2006
====================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be held in the Computer Science department of
Heinrich-Heine Universitaet Duesseldorf from the 2nd to the 9th of June.

The main focus of the sprint will be on the goals of the upcoming June 0.9
release:

* The extension module compiler.  The goal is to be able to use a single
  RPython source code as an extension module for both PyPy and CPython.
  The means to get there is -- most likely -- by compiling ctypes-based
  modules into either pypy-c or a CPython dll/so.

* Write some more modules in this style with ctypes.

* Stackless: the big missing feature is pickling running tasklets.
  There is also some smaller work that needs to be done, like exposing
  all the existing RPython-level interfaces to app-level
  (e.g. greenlets).

* Write more documentation.

* Misc topics, depending on interests: back-ends (CLI, Squeak), testing
  framework, modified semantics (security/sandboxing...), etc.

If you'd like to come, please subscribe to the `pypy-sprint mailing list`_
and drop a note about your interests and post any questions.  More 
organisational information will be send to that list.  We'll keep
a list of `people`_ which we'll update (which you can do so yourself
if you have codespeak commit rights).
