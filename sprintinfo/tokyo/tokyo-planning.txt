Thursday, 27th April 2006
*************************

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon, Nik, Anders

Status after day 3:

  - gencl (Sanghyeon, Valentino)

    * refactored another bit
    * superclasses and inheritance and isinstance and range
    * Record type

  - Pickle support for cell objects (Eric)
    * works but breaks translation

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Samuele)

    * Improved forward references and made the List type lazily inittable.
    * Introduced the Record type
    * Introduced Range support in the OOTypeSystem.

  - ctypes _socket (and select ;))  (Arre, Anders)

    * Passing 14 tests for the translatable module
    * It should be translatable now (although not tested)

Pairings today:

  - Pickling cells (Eric)

    * fix translation
    * add support for additional objects like code objects.

  - ctypes _socket (Arre, Anders)

    * Pass all previous tests.
    * start proper translation work.

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Sanghyeon)

    * Dictionaries need to be lazy too.
    * Record type for iterator and tuples and make it generic
    * String type

  - progress further on rpystone gencl translation (Valentino)

  - general wizardry (Samuele)
  
Friday, 28th April 2006
************************

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon, Nik, Anders

Status after day 4:

  - gencl (Sanghyeon, Valentino)

    * constant instances now supported which enables the metaclass 
      model and class variables
    * refactoring is ongoing

  - Pickle support for cell objects (Eric)

    * cell, code, function partly there but needs moduledict support

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Samuele)

    * introduced record type for iterators and tuples
    * random smaller improvements

  - ctypes _socket (and select ;))  (Arre, Anders)

    * passing all tests
    * uses only ctypes now but doesn't translate yet

Pairings today:

  - Pickling cells (Eric)

    * add support for additional objects like code objects.

  - ctypes _socket (Arre, Anders)

    * continue translation work.

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Sanghyeon)

    * Dictionaries need to be lazy too.
    * String type

  - gencl (Valentino, Sanghyeon)

    * exception handling
    * rpystone translation

  - general wizardry (Samuele)
  
Saturday, 29th April 2006
***************************

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Anders, Yusei, Koichi

Status after day 5:

  - gencl (Sanghyeon, Valentino)

    * Somewhat working exception handling support, but it violates
      the specification.

  - Pickle support for objects (Eric, Samuele)
    
    * We added module, moduledict, functions

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Samuele)

    * fixed very obscure bug (see r26507 for the dirty details)
    * splitting stringsupport between ootype and lltype system
      (will need more work, since this broke translation)
    
  - ctypes _socket (and select ;))  (Arre, Anders)

    * annotation workds, rtyping in progress.
    * now supporting recursive structures in rctypes
    * errno needs a bit more support in rctypes. More specifically,
      errno can be many different things (a define, a function Xi
      (sometimes thread specific)) but all platform specific.
    * ipv6 support is not (ahum) complete
    * no windows support yet
    
Pairings today:

  - Pickling (Eric, Yusei)

    * add support for additional objects like code objects.

  - ctypes _socket (Arre, Anders)

    * continue translation work.

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik)

    * fix String type translation issue

  - gencl (Valentino)

    * exception handling
    * rpystone translation

  - general wizardry (Samuele)

Saturday, 29th April - Closing session
***************************************

  - gencl (Valentino)
    * exceptions are now correctly supported
    * gencl has been resurrected and can translate most of the basic operations
    * rpystone has not been translated yet because of Strings (and maybe other things)

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik)
    * We got rid of ForwardReferences and now have full support for recursive types
    * New Record type
    * preliminary string support

  - Pickling (Eric, Yusei)
    * Everything is picklable except: SequenceIterators, DictIterators, 
         Frames, Traceback and generators

  - ctypes and _socket: Please one of the anders should comment on this.
