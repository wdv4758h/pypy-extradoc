Tokyo 2006 Sprint Report
=============================

Parts of the PyPy team visited Tokyo and hosted a sprint between 23-29th of April, 2006.
We sprinted in the facilities of the National Institute of Advanced Science and 
Technology, being invited by The Free Software Initiative of Japan. The idea was to 
promote Python as a programming language and present PyPy for Japanese hackers.

Here is the list of people participating in the sprint:

  * Anders Lehmann 
  * Nik Haldimann
  * Samuele Pedronis
  * Beatrice Düring
  * Anders Chrigstrom (Arre)
  * Eric Van Riet Paap
  * Valentino Volonghi
  * Sanghyeon Seo
  * Yutaka Niibe
  * Yusei Tahara
  * George Toshida
  * Koichi Sasada

The announced goals for the sprint were: 
  - Work on gensqueak (our Squeak backend) or possibly other backends.

  - Implementing Python 2.5 features in PyPy.

  - Progress further on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.

  - Writing ctypes implementations of modules to be used by the above
    tool.

  - Experimenting and improving performance of our garbage collectors.

  - Experiment with PyPy flexibility or other aspects of the implementation.

  - Possibly experiment with writing modules translatable for use both
    in PyPy and CPython.
  
  - Whatever participants want to do with PyPy or particular areas
    of PyPy (please send suggestions to the mailing list before to allow us to plan 
    and give feedback) 

After an initial round of checking general interests in the group during the first day we ended 
up with this list - the content of the sprint is a mix between these goald and interests 
and of course all topics on these lists were not achieved although we were productive ;-):

  - gensqueak/ootypesystem 

  - Implementing Python 2.5 features in PyPy. 

  - Progress further on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.

    - check status
    - ctypes time and socket (and select ;))

  - rctypes support for LLVM (Eric)

  - convert JS backend to ootypesystem 

  - genjs test failure fixes 

  - raisingops transformation 

  - PyPy debian packaging?

  - Fun with the Common Lisp backend 

  - Possibly experiment with writing modules translatable for use both
    in PyPy and CPython.
