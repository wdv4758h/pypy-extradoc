people present:
    Christian Timser

done so far:

    Christian works on win64 support, continuing the job started in Genua

    Hakan refactors unrolling: adds a TARGET resoperation that can be used
    in the middle of loops, and that defines a possible JUMP target.

    Armin did random stuff including progress on the STM branch.

    Mark worked on specializing 2-tuples to contain int/floats/strings.

    Andrew Dalke and Sam Lade worked on the previous days on numpy
    integration, looking at f2py


today:
    
    the TARGET resoperation: Hakan, Armin

    win64: Christian

    specialized 2-tuples: Mark, Anto
