PyPy San Francisco Sprint Dec 1st - Dec 2nd 2012
================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in San Francisco, California. It is a
public sprint, suitable for newcomers. It will run on Saturday December 1st and
Sunday December 2nd. The goals for the sprint are continued work towards the
2.0 release as well as code cleanup, we of course welcome any topic which
contributors are interested in working on.

Some other possible topics are:

* running your software on PyPy

* work on PyPy's numpy (status__)

* work on STM (status__)

* JIT improvements

* any exciting stuff you can think of

If there are newcomers, we'll run the usual introduction to hacking on
PyPy.
