PyPy Cape Town Sprint Oct 7th - Oct 21st 2012
=============================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Cape Town, South Africa. It is a public sprint, 
suitable for newcomers. The sprint is hosted after the end of
`PyCon South Africa`_, which happens on 4th and 5th of October.
This is a relatively unusual sprint that is hosted
halfway across the world from where most contributors live, hence we plan
to spend some time during those 2 weeks doing sprinting and some time doing
touristy stuff. The goals for the sprint are general progress and whatever
people are interested in.

Location
--------

The sprint will be either held in the apartment of fijal, which is in
Tamboerskloof, Cape Town or in the office of Praekelt Foundation, located
in Woodstock, Cape Town.

Cape Town, as a very touristy place, has tons of accomodation going from
good to amazing. Depending on the sprint location you might need a car.


Good to Know
------------

You very likely don't need visa for South Africa, consult the wikipedia.
South Africa is a lovely place with lots of stuff to visit. You can come
and see penguins, elephants, lions and sharks all in one (or more) day.

There is a wide selection of good restaurants within a reasonable distance
from the sprint venue (depending on the venue, either walking or driving).

The power plug is some weird old-english standard, but adapters are easy
to acquire in every shop.

Who's Coming?
--------------

If you'd like to come, please let us know when you will be arriving and 
leaving, as well as letting us know your interests  We'll keep a list
of `people`_ which we'll update (which you can do so yourself if you
have bitbucket pypy commit rights).
