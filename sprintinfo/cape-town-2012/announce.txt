PyPy Cape Town Sprint Oct 7th - Oct 21st 2012
=============================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Cape Town, South Africa. It is a public sprint, 
suitable for newcomers. The sprint is hosted after the end of
`PyCon South Africa`_, which happens on 4th and 5th of October.
This is a relatively unusual sprint that is hosted
halfway across the world from where most contributors live, hence we plan
to spend some time during those 2 weeks doing sprinting and some time doing
touristy stuff. The goals for the sprint are general progress and whatever
people are interested in.

Location
--------

The sprint will be either held in the apartment of fijal, which is in
Tamboerskloof, Cape Town or in the office of Praekelt Foundation, located
in Woodstock, Cape Town.

Cape Town, as a very touristy place, has tons of accomodation going from
good to amazing. Depending on the sprint location you might need a car.


Good to Know
------------

XXXX rewrite

Sweden is not part of the Euro zone. One SEK (krona in singular, kronor
in plural) is roughly 1/10th of a Euro (9.36 SEK to 1 Euro).

The venue is central in Gothenburg.  There is a large selection of
places to get food nearby, from edible-and-cheap to outstanding.  We
often cook meals together, so let us know if you have any food allergies,
dislikes, or special requirements.

Sweden uses the same kind of plugs as Germany. 230V AC.
