Achievements:

We implemented most of the necessary primitives for solving logic and
constraint problems (tell, ask, choose, commit). The missing one is
clone.

We adapted the current constraint solver components (domains,
constraint propagators, distributors) to make it fit the requirements
of logic programming (they share the same basic primitives).

Logic variables are used internally as a coordination mechanism
between threads. The current implementation would not support
preemptive threading -- that would need even more coordination of this
kind.

So right now, it is possible to explore exactly one branch of the
search tree at a time.

Next:
-----

* translatability

* make cloning work

* adapt OWL reasoner to the current solver API
