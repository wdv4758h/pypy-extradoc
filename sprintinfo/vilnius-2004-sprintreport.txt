Vilnius (Nov 2004)
========================

I don't really remember what others did at this sprint, but this is where 
Laura and I wrote the file I/O handling.

People I remember being there: Marius Gedminas, Bob Ippolito, Christian, 
Armin.

IIRC everyone was overjoyed when PyPy managed to completely translate
into C and compute the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and
Everything (def somefunc(): return -6 * -7).
