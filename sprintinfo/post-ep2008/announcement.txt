========================================================
Vilnius/Post EuroPython PyPy Sprint 10-12th of July
========================================================

The PyPy team is sprinting at EuroPython again and we invite
you to participate in our 3 day long sprint at the conference hotel
- Reval Hotel Lietuva.

If you plan to attend the sprint we recommend you to listen to the PyPy
technical talks (`EuroPython schedule`_) during the
conference since it will give you a good overview of the status of development.

On the morning of the first sprint day (10th) we will also have a
tutorial session for those new to PyPy development.  As 3 days is relatively
short for a PyPy sprint we suggest to travel back home on the 13th if
possible (but it is ok to attend less than 3 days too).

------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

There are many possible and interesting sprint topics to work on - here
we list some possible task areas:

* try out Python programs and fix them or fix PyPy or fix performance bottlenecks
* some JIT improvement work
* port the stackless transform to ootypesystem
* other interesting stuff that you would like to work on ...;-)
