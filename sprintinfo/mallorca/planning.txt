Tasks
======

  - JIT: 
    Graph generating ops
    Designed interface (see draft-jit-ideas),
    Refactored llabstractinterp to use the operations
    Started trying to reuse the annotator framework
    for off-line partial evaluation
    Progress, now trying to annotate the toy language interp.
    Arre,  Samuele, Armin on Virtual List
 
  - integration of the garbage collection toolkit with the
    DONE: offsetof, sizeof work done
    Started: insert GC neeeded behaviour as graph transformations.
    Writing a new function generator in genc for the transformed
    graphs... Added cleanup attribute to operations. 
    Branched, genc working again with refcounting. Next: finishing
    plus Boehm policy and likely merging.
    Michael (Samuele) 

  - stackless application level interface: Christian, 
    started from the demo coroutine impl, trying to expose
    at application level, both greenlet and stackless-like interfaces.
    DONE: Exposed coroutines at application-level, support for flags on
    the coroutines to use for other concurrency primitives to
    construct on top of them.
    IN-PROGRESS: extending interface such that coroutines, tasklet,
    greenlets can co-exist peacefully. Now implementing greenlets...

  - improving the way we interface with external functions.
    (also think about how exceptions fit in there):
    add static ctypes functionality into RPython itself
    DONE: glued atoi from ctypes (cheating a bit)
    DONE: basic annotation for ctypes structures and basics types.
    Working on annotating ctypes arrays
    Annotating derefencing. Trying to track ownerships...
    Next would be rtyping...
    Gerald, Stephan

  - express exception raising operations in the graphs as
    calls to helpers (backends could use their special 
    operations) SOME PROGRESS
    Eric, Richard

  ( - l3interp/offsetof/sizeof work:
    Progress. Progress needs either hacks and assuming Boehm
    or GC integration. Try to progress assuming Boehm )


later:
======

  - our threading implementation is still incredibly
    slow, we need to work on that.

  - refactor argument handling and calls in the object space

  - look into how the LLVM JIT works

  - transformations to be more clever with checking for
    exceptions

  - socket module
    already improved but still far from complete
