=====================================================================
         PyPy Leysin Winter Sprint (11-19st January 2014)
=====================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the
ninth time.  This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics
other than those proposed below are welcome.

------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

* Py3k: work towards supporting Python 3 in PyPy 

* NumPyPy: work towards supporting the numpy module in PyPy 

* STM: work towards supporting Software Transactional Memory

* And as usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-)
  We can take a day off for ski.

Exact times
-----------

For a change, and as an attempt to simplify things, I specified the
dates as 11-19 January 2014, where 11 and 19 are travel days.  We will
work full days between the 12 and the 18.  You are of course allowed
to show up for a part of that time only, too.

-----------------------
Location & Accomodation
-----------------------

Leysin, Switzerland, "same place as before".  Let me refresh your
memory: both the sprint venue and the lodging will be in a very spacious
pair of chalets built specifically for bed & breakfast:
http://www.ermina.ch/.  The place has a good ADSL Internet connexion
with wireless installed.  You can of course arrange your own
lodging anywhere (as long as you are in Leysin, you cannot be more than a
15 minutes walk away from the sprint venue), but I definitely recommend
lodging there too -- you won't find a better view anywhere else (though you
probably won't get much worse ones easily, either :-)

Please *confirm* that you are coming so that we can adjust the reservations
as appropriate.  The rate so far has been around 60 CHF a night all included
in 2-person rooms, with breakfast.  There are larger rooms too (less
expensive per person) and maybe the possibility to get a single room if you
really want to.

You need a Swiss-to-(insert country here) power adapter.  There will be
some Swiss-to-EU adapters around -- bring a EU-format power strip if you
have one.
