Place: Pycon 2008

Dates: 17th March 2008 - 20th March 2008

Project: PyPy (http://codespeak.net/pypy)

Project description: PyPy is a python compiler written in Python. It's also
a very flexible compiler toolchain which can compile so called RPython
(restricted Python, a subset of Python without dynamic features) into
a variety of platforms including C/POSIX, JVM and CLI. PyPy also features
a set of experimental features, like different GCs or different threading
models, which makes it a good platform to experiment with the python language.

Sprint leader: Maciej Fijalkowski (fijal@merlinux.de)

Attendees: list will be available at
http://codespeak.net/pypy/extradoc/sprintinfo/pycon2008/people.txt

Instructions: Suggestions for contributors would be to come to #pypy
at irc.freenode.net in order to create a codespeak account. In any case,
repository and all documentation are available on the website.

Some instructions: This sprint is newcomer-friendly sprint. We'll present
a PyPy tutorial and code-walk on Sunday afternoon. The list of task is as usual
very long and depending on attendees. It's suggested that people would
come to an IRC and chat a bit to have a clue what is feasible on a sprint
and what is not. For example, we can work on:

* JVM backend bindings for Java libraries
* Extending pypy as necessary for software X to run
* Adding more modules to pypy
* Sketching ctypes-based software, killing dependency on C modules
  written using C/CPython API.
* Optimizing certain parts of pypy for certain micro-benchmarks.
* Whatever else....

Software requirements: the details depends on what people would like to
work on, but in general pygame, libgc and libffi are very very useful (although
not needed). A PyPy checkout, gcc and such things are a must. For people
wanting to work on particular backends, appropriately Java, Mono (or .NET),
spidermonkey are needed.
