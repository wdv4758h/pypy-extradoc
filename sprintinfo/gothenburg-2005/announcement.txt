Gothenburg PyPy Sprint II: 7th - 11th December 2005 
======================================================
(NOTE: internal EU-only sprint starts on the 5th!)

The next PyPy sprint is scheduled to be in December 2005 in Gothenburg,
Sweden.  Its main focus is heading towards phase 2, which means JIT
work, alternate threading models and logic programming (but there are
also other possible topics).  We'll give newcomer-friendly
introductions.  To learn more about the new PyPy Python-in-Python
implementation look here:

Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

We have released pypy-0.8.0_, which is officially a "research base" for
future work.  The goal of the Gothenburg sprint is to start exploring
new directions and continue in the directions started at the Paris
sprint.

The currently scheduled main topics are:

 - The L3 interpreter, a small fast interpreter for "assembler-level"
   flow graphs.  This is heading towards JIT work.

 - Stackless: write an app-level interface, which might be either
   Tasklets, as in "Stackless CPython", or the more limited Greenlets.

 - Porting C modules from CPython.  (_socket is not finished)

 - Optimization/debugging work in general.  In particular our thread
   support is far from stable at the moment and unaccountably slow.

 - Experimentation: logic programming in Python.  A first step might be
   to try to add logic variables to PyPy.

Location & Accomodation  
------------------------ 

The sprint will be held in the apartment of Laura Creighton and Jacob
Hallén which is at Götabergsgatan 22.  Here is a map_.  This is in central
Gothenburg.  It is between the tram_ stops of Vasaplatsen and Valand,
where many lines call.

Probably cheapest and not too far away is to book accomodation at `SGS
Veckobostader`_.  (You can have a 10% discount there; ask in the
pypy-sprint mailing list for details.  We also have some possibilites of
free accomodation.)  There are also hotels to suit every price range
and desire for luxury.  Just ask in the mailing list.

Exact times 
-----------

The public PyPy sprint is held Wednesday 7th - Sunday 11th December
2005.  There is a sprint for people involved with the EU part of the
project on the two days before the "official" sprint.  Hours will be
from 10:00 until people have had enough.  It's a good idea to arrive a
day before the sprint starts and leave a day later.  In the middle of
the sprint there usually is a break day and it's usually ok to take
half-days off if you feel like it.


Network, Food, currency 
------------------------ 

Sweden is not part of the Euro zone. One SEK (krona in singular, kronor
in plural) is roughly 1/10th of a Euro (9.15 SEK to 1 Euro).

The venue is central in Gothenburg.  There is a large selection of
places to get food around, from edible-and-cheap to outstanding.

You normally need a wireless network card to access the network, but we
can provide a wireless/ethernet bridge.

Sweden uses the same kind of plugs as Germany. 230V AC.

Registration etc.pp.
